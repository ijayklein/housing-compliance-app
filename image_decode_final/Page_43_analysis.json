It starts with excluding certain lot types, then divides remaining lots into 'Front-half pattern lots' and 'Rear-half pattern lots' based on garage placement. It then determines the predominant pattern. If the contextual garage placement regulation applies, it states that projects on the block must place the garage in the rear half of the lot.
