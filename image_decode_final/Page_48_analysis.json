It shows a 'Buildable area' (light grey dashed outline) containing a 'Main dwelling' (dark grey solid shape). Two lightwells/stairwells are depicted: one (black solid shape) encroaching into the interior-side yard, labeled with 'c' for its length and '3' max. width' for its width, and another (white solid shape) also in the interior-side yard, labeled with 'd' for its length. The diagram includes dimensions for setbacks and encroachments: '3' min. from lot line (Typ.)' and '3' max. into side yard (Typ.)'. The interior-side yard is labeled on both sides of the main dwelling. The diagram also shows a lightwell/stairwell (black solid shape) on the other interior-side yard, labeled with 'b' for its length, and another (white solid shape) on the rear of the dwelling, labeled with 'a' for its length. A '3' max width' label is associated with the lightwell/stairwell on the rear of the dwelling.",
