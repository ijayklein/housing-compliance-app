Each diagram shows a portion of a building wall with a bay window extending outwards. Diagram A shows a bay window that does not count, with a clear 18\" minimum clearance from the floor joists. Diagram B shows a bay window where floor joists continue into the bay window, indicating it counts. Diagrams C & D show bay windows with an exterior skirt wall (angled or straight), indicating they count. Diagram E shows a bay window with less than 50% glass surface, indicating it counts. There is also a dimension line indicating '2' max. from bay window surface to facade surface (Typical all)' and '18\" min. from top of floor to bottom of baywindow structure'.",
