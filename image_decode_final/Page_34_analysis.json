Various dimensions and setback lines are indicated with arrows and labels. The diagram includes a ground line with hatching, a 'Rear yard' area, a 'Setback line', and a 'Rear lot line'. A dashed line representing the daylight plane extends from the setback line at a 60-degree angle upwards and over the building. Protrusion limits are shown above the building.",
