It shows a 1st floor, a 2nd floor, and an attic level. Key areas are labeled 'A' (in the attic) and 'B' (on the 2nd floor, possibly a closet or sloped ceiling area). A vertical measurement of 5' is indicated from the floor to the underside of the rafter on the 2nd floor. Stairs are visible connecting the floors. The diagram also points to '1st floor' and 'underside of rafter'. There's a 'CC' label near the stairs on the 2nd floor.",
