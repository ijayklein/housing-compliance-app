Five R-1 zones\nreflect and preserve traditional lotting patterns with criteria\nfor minimum and maximum lot sizes.\n\nMin. & max. lot sizes by zone\n\nThe subdivision ordinance requires a new lot to have\nA) width \u2265 60' AND depth \u2265 100' AND\nB) lot area (in sf) per the following:\n\nExceptions to the max. lot size\n\n\u2022 Where underlying lot lines must be removed to elimi-\nnate non-conformities and results in no net loss of\nhousing.\n\u2022 Where an adjacent substandard lot of less than 25' in\nwidth is combined with another lot and results in no\nnet loss of housing.\n\u2022 Where the resultant number of lots increases or stays\nthe same and results in no net loss of housing.\n\nSubstandard lots\n\nEven within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes.\nSmaller lots that meet the following criteria are considered\nto be substandard.\n\nSubstandard lot sizes by zone\n\nA sub-standard lot is one with\nA) width < 50' OR depth < 83' AND\nB) area \u2264 the following (83% of min. lot size):\n\nSpecial regulations for substandard lots\n\n\u2022 Maximum building height is single-story and 17'\ninstead of 30'\n\u2022 For lots less than 50' wide, the required street-sid\nyard is 10' instead of 16'. (Fig 15 C on p. 23)\n\u2022 For lots less than 95' deep, the requirements for locat-\ning a garage in the rear or side yards are that it be in\nthe rear half of the lot instead of 75' back from the\nfront lot line.\n\nNote: Determining where lot\nlines are on the ground may\nrequire a boundary survey.",
