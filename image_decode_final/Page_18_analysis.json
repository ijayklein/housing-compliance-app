The Isometric View shows a 3D perspective of a house entrance with a gabled roof, indicating 'Height' from 'Grade' to the roof ridge. The Side Elevation shows a 2D profile of the same entry feature, also indicating 'Height' from 'Grade' and pointing to the 'Intersection of front facade and top of roof material at ridge'. The Porch Floor Plan shows a top-down view of the entryway, with dashed lines indicating the 'Outline of entryway floor area that counts TWICE if entryway is vaulted' and the 'Outline of entry-way roof'.",
