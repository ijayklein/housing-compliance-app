          "description": "A flowchart illustrating the process to determine if a contextual setback applies. It starts with a question 'Does block have more than 3 lots? (incl project lot)'. If 'Yes', it leads to 'Exclude the following types of lots: Flag lot (C), Multi-family use w/ 3+ units (G), Corner lot facing cross street (H)'. This then leads to 'Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?'. If 'Yes', it leads to 'Exclude the smallest and largest setbacks: Smallest (D), Largest (E)'. Finally, it leads to 'Find the average of the remaining lots (incl. subject lot). If greater than 30', it applies.' with a calculation example: '30 (A) + 33 (B) + 35 (F) = 98 \u00f7 3 = 32.7'.",

It shows a block of land with multiple lots (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) and their respective setbacks from the street. Lots A, B, D, E, F are 'Single-Family' with setbacks of 30', 33', 20', 37', and 35' respectively. Lot C is a 'Flag lot'. Lot G is 'Multiple-Family (3 + units)'. Lot H is a 'Lot fronts onto other street' with a 'Street sideyard'. Lots C, D, G, H are crossed out with large 'X' marks, indicating their exclusion from the calculation. The diagram also includes a 'Key' explaining symbols for 'Lot line', 'Sidewalk', 'Curb', 'Required setbacks', 'Buildable area', and 'Existing house'.",
