'Pavers without mortar (grass between) OK': Shows a cross-section of pavers with grass growing in between, indicating it's an acceptable permeable surface.\n2. '\"Hollywood strips\" (grass between) OK': Shows a cross-section of two parallel strips of paving with grass in between, also indicating an acceptable permeable surface.\n3. 'Gravel OK': Shows a cross-section of a gravel driveway. This diagram also includes detailed annotations for various dimensions and requirements:\n    - A curved section at the top right, labeled with an arrow pointing to text: 'Turns enroute to required parking spaces must be deemed maneuverable by the Transportation Division.'\n    - A horizontal line with an arrow pointing to text: '8' min. width for driveway surface (typ. all)'\n    - A horizontal line with an arrow pointing to text: '10' min. width for driveway clearance (typ. all)'\n    - A vertical dimension line labeled '10' min' indicating a minimum depth or clearance.\n    - An arrow pointing to the gravel layer with text: 'No gravel or similar loose materials within 10' of the public right-of-way (lot line)'\n    - An arrow pointing to the base layer and extending to the right with text: 'Work done within the public ROW requires a street-work permit and must comply with city standards.'\nAll three diagrams show a base layer beneath the surface material and a representation of the ground/sub-base.",
