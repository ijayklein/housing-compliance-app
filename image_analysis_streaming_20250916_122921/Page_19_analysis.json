Therefore, the area will count three times toward gross floor area.\"\n\n**Note 2 (Right side):**\n\"If the entryway is considered to be a vaulted entryway the area will be counted as follows:\"\n\n**Bullet Points under Note 2:**\n\u2022 \"In this example, a portion of the entryway is recessed beyond the house facade and roof. It is included in the area that counts.\"\n\n\u2022 \"The area is measured to the outside material of the entryway feature.\"\n\n\u2022 \"The area counts TWICE toward gross floor area.\"\n\n**Diagram Labels:**\n- Isometric View\n- Side Elevation  \n- Porch Floor Plan\n- \"Height\" (with measurement arrows)\n- \"Grade\" \n- \"Intersection of front facade and underside or bottom of 2nd floor\"\n- \"Top of 2nd floor\"\n- \"Bottom of 2nd floor\"\n- \"Outline of entryway floor area that counts TWICE if entryway is vaulted\"\n\n**Page Number:**\n13\n\nThe page contains three architectural drawings (isometric view, side elevation, and porch floor plan) illustrating the measurement and calculation rules for vaulted entryways in relation to gross floor area calculations."
