This may be illustrated by comparing Roof Plans 1 & 2 of Fig 10.\n\n## Figure Reference:\nFig 10 Balconies\n[Contains an isometric drawing showing a building with balconies, labeled with \"Roof plan 1\" and \"Roof plan 2\"]\n\n## Roof Plan Analysis:\n\n### Roof Plan 1:\n- **Area A**: Counts because it is roofed\n- **Area B**: Does not count because this arbor is substantially open\n- **Area C**: Does not count because the overhang is the same size as the overhang around the rest of the house and is considered to be open\n\n### Roof Plan 2:\n- **Area A**: Counts because it is roofed\n- **Area B**: Counts because the overhang here is greater than the overhang around the rest of the house, and considered to be roofed\n- **Area C**: Does not count because it is open\n\n## Additional Note:\n**Note: Pop-out balconies are subject to the same evaluation.**\n\n## Page Number:\n15"
