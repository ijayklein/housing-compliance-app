If the porch space is higher, the area will count again as 2nd story equivalency.\n\n## Figure 9 - Recessed porches on the 1st floor\n\nThe page contains two architectural diagrams labeled A and B showing isometric views of buildings with recessed porches.\n\n**Example A:**\n- This example complies with all three criteria and does NOT count toward gross floor area\n- Shows \"Porch ceiling below 2nd floor\" annotation\n- Shows \"2nd floor line\" marking\n\n**Example B:**\n- This example violates two of the three criteria:\n  \u2022 the porch depth is greater than 10' and\n  \u2022 the porch ceiling is above the 2nd floor\n- Therefore it DOES count toward gross floor area and if it is higher than 17\" it will count twice (see note).\n- Shows \"Height extends past 2nd floor line\" annotation\n- Shows \"2nd floor line\" marking\n\nPage number: 14"
