These are closed segments, or sides.\n- **Reference**: In Fig 5 sides A, B, & C abut the house walls. These are considered to be closed segments.\n\n## Step 3: Segment Status Determination\n- **Rule**: Determine the status (open/closed) of the remaining segments based on the design. If at least 50% of the facade area is open, then the segment or side is considered open.\n\n### For purposes of assessing the openess of the facade:\n\n**Height Measurement**:\n- The height of the segment facades is measured from the top of the porch floor to the point where the segment facade intersects with the top of the roof material.\n\n**Width Measurement**:\n- The widths of the segment facades are measured from the same plane. Allowances may be made for structural supports that are not excessive.\n\n### Diagram Specifications:\nThe bottom diagram shows four segments labeled D, E, F, and G with the following measurements:\n\n- **Segment D**: 7' width - Status: **Open**\n- **Segment E**: 14' width - Status: **Closed** (because of decorative glass wall)\n- **Segment F**: 24' width - Status: **Open**  \n- **Segment G**: 4' width - Status: **Open**\n\n**Additional notation**: \n- \"Height = 8'\" is marked on the diagram\n- \"Porch flr\" is labeled\n- \"Intersection facade & top of roof material\" is indicated with an arrow\n\nThe page number shown is 9."
