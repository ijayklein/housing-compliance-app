It is the sum of segments **A** through **G**. It is 70 linear feet.\n\n### Diagram measurements shown:\n- Segment A: 5'\n- Segment B: 8' \n- Segment C: 6'\n- Segment D: 7'\n- Segment E: 14'\n- Segment F: 24'\n- Segment G: 4'\n\n**Page number:** 8\n\nThe page includes an isometric drawing of a house with a roofed porch and a corresponding floor plan diagram showing the labeled segments A through G with their respective measurements."
