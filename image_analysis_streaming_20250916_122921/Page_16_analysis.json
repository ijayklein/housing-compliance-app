This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right:\n\n\u2022 Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls.\n\u2022 A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.\n\nThe diagram shows measurements including:\n- 36\" height requirement\n- Safety rail placement\n- Porch floor elevation\n- Grade reference\n- Both solutions labeled as \"Open\"\n\n**Page Number:** 10"
