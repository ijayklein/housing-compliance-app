However, for zoning purposes, the lot is defined by the edge of the public street easement or public right-of-way (ROW). Dimensions for the public ROW are available at the Development Center.\n\n**Fig 2 Gross lot area exclusions: flag-lot \"poles\"**\n- Shows flag lot overlapping private easement and flag lot with \"pole\"\n- \"pole\" portion of a lot must be subtracted from the gross lot size\n- Note: Private access easements that provide access to lots are NOT subtracted from the lot on which they occur.\n\n**Fig 3 Gross lot area exclusions: creek easements**\n- Shows lot with creek and/or creek easement\n- The portion of the lot within a creek channel must be subtracted from gross lot size\n- Notes: The channel or area to be subtracted is defined by Santa Clara Valley Water District's easement or, if there is no easement, the top-of-bank. Determining the top-of-bank may require a surveyor.\n\n## Key\n- Curb\n- Sidewalk\n- Lot lines\n- Creek\n- Area that must be subtracted from gross lot area\n\nPage 3"
