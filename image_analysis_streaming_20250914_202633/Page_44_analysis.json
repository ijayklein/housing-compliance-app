Each example shows a lot with labeled areas: 'Buildable area' (shaded light gray), 'Main dwelling' (darker gray), and parking structures (black boxes labeled '1-car attached' or '2-car attached'). The diagrams include lot lines, curbs, sidewalks, required setbacks (dashed lines), no-parking areas (hatched lines), and uncovered spaces (depicted with a car icon). The first two diagrams are labeled 'Interior lot example' and the third 'Corner lot example'. Each diagram shows front yard, rear yard, interior-side yard, and street-side yard boundaries. A 10' measurement is indicated on the street-side yard in the corner lot example. The diagrams correspond to three scenarios: A) 1-car garage with a second uncovered space in the sideyard, B) 1-car garage with a second uncovered space in the driveway, and C) 2-car garage with no uncovered spaces.",
