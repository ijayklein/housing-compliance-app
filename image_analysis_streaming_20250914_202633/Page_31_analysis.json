          "description": "Three side-by-side schematic site plans illustrating allowable extensions of existing walls encroaching into required yards. Each plan shows a lot with labeled 'Rear yard', 'Front yard', and 'Interior side yard' or 'Street side yard'. The diagrams depict existing houses (shaded gray) and additions (shaded black) extending from existing walls. Dimensions and setback lines are marked, including '5' min.' for side yard, '14' min.' for front yard, and '10' min.' for street-side yard. Arrows and labels indicate 'Length of existing encroaching wall max.' and 'Half the width of the building max.'. A dashed line represents the buildable area, solid lines indicate lot lines, and a hatched area shows the sidewalk. A note below the left diagram states 'Only one of the two encroaching walls may be extended'.",
