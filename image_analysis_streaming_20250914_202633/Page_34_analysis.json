The drawing includes two dormer protrusions on the roof, each with a maximum protrusion of 7.5 feet and a minimum separation of 5 feet between them. Vertical measurements indicate a 24-foot maximum for protrusions and a 16-foot height dimension. The maximum building height is marked with a dashed line extending above the roof. The drawing also shows setback and rear lot line positions with arrows and labels. Angle of 60 degrees is indicated at the roof slope near the rear daylight plane line.",
