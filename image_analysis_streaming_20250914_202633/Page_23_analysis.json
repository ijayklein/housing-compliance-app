Both diagrams show a pitched roof with labeled height markers at 17' and 26' above the 1st floor. The left diagram highlights Area A and Area B with shaded regions: Area A counts once as 1st floor, again as 2nd floor, and a third time as 3rd-floor equivalency; Area B counts once as 1st floor and again as 2nd-floor equivalency. The inaccessible attic for vaulted ceiling is marked in the upper roof space. Widths of areas that count as 2nd-floor and 3rd-floor equivalency are indicated with double-headed arrows. The right diagram similarly shows the inaccessible attic for vaulted ceiling and vaulted ceiling space in Area B, with the same height markers and width annotations.",
