Each diagram shows a lot with labeled areas including 'Rear yard', 'Front yard', 'Interior side yard', 'Buildable area', 'Main dwelling', and 'Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max'. Parking garages are shown as black boxes labeled with car capacity (1-car detached, 1-car attached, 2-car detached, 2-car attached). Driveways and sidewalks are depicted with lines and shading. Minimum 12' spacing between buildings is indicated. Each diagram corresponds to one of the four parking scenarios (A, B, C, D) described in the text. The diagrams include labels for curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, dwelling, buildable area, 2nd-dwelling unit & associated parking, area that may not be used to satisfy required parking spaces, and uncovered space.",
