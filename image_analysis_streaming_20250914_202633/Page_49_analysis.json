The plan shows a 10' minimum separation between below-grade patios. Landscaping screening is indicated with tree icons. The key explains symbols for curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, buildable area, dwelling, lightwells & stairwells, lightwells & stairwells that encroach into required yards, and landscaping screening.",
