          "description": "Figure 24 shows three schematic site planning examples for accessory structures: A) Combo garage/small pool cabana side by side, B) Stand-alone pool cabana, and C) Office above garage. Each example includes a site plan diagram illustrating the location of the accessory structure relative to the main dwelling, lot lines, yards (rear, front, interior/side, street side), and required setbacks. The diagrams highlight minimum distance requirements (e.g., 75' from front lot line), fire-rated walls at lot lines, and plumbing fixture counts. The diagrams use shading and labels to differentiate buildable areas, required setbacks, sidewalks, curbs, lot lines, dwellings/parking, and accessory structures. Notes clarify special conditions such as the allowance for garages in rear/side yards and requirements for two-story structures.",
