The diagram includes labeled dimensions for light wells and stairwells: '3' max width' on two sides, '3' min. from lot line (Typ.)', '3' max. into side yard (Typ.)'. The diagram uses different line styles and shading to indicate curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, buildable area, dwelling, and lightwells & stairwells. A key explains these symbols and patterns. The diagram visually represents the spatial relationship and allowable encroachments of light wells and stairwells relative to the lot lines and yards.",
