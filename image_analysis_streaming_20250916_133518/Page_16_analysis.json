    "raw_content": "Based on the photocopied page from this city planning technical manual, I can extract the following information with absolute precision:\n\n## Step 4: Finalize the determination of which segments are closed and which are open, total the linear feet in each category, and compare the totals.\n\n### Porch Analysis Summary (referencing Fig 5):\n\n**Closed Segments:**\n- Segment A: 3' Feet\n- Segment B: 8' Feet  \n- Segment C: 10' Feet\n- Segment E: 14' Feet\n- **Total: 35' Feet**\n\n**Open Segments:**\n- Segment D: 7' Feet\n- Segment F: 24' Feet\n- Segment G: 4' Feet\n- **Total: 35' Feet**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe perimeter of the porch in Fig 5 is 50% open and so the porch would **NOT** count toward gross floor area.\n\n### Technical Note for Elevated Porches:\nIf a porch floor is more than 30\" above grade, the porch sides may need to be 36\" high for safety reasons. This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right:\n\n\u2022 Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls.\n\u2022 A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.\n\n### Diagram Specifications:\nThe page includes a technical diagram showing:\n- Dimension D: 7'\n- Dimension B: 8' \n- Dimension F: 24'\n- Dimension measurements for safety rail and porch floor heights (36\" and 30\" measurements shown)\n- Labels indicating \"Open\" sections\n- Safety rail and grade level indicators\n\n**Page Number:** 10",
