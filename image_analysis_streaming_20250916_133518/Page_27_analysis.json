(incl. project lot)\"\n- Note: If block is more than 600' long, consider only lots within 600' (max. 10 lots).\n\n### Step 2: Exclusion Criteria\nIf **Yes** to Step 1, exclude the following types of lots:\n- Flag lot (G)\n- Multifamily use w/ 3+ units (G)\n- Corner lot facing cross street (H)\n\n### Step 3: Lot Count Assessment\n- Question: \"Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?\"\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nIf **Yes** to Step 3, exclude the smallest and largest setbacks:\n- Smallest (D)\n- Largest (E)\n\nFind the average of the remaining lots (incl. subject lot). If greater than 30', it applies.\n\n### Example Calculation Shown\n30 (A) + 33 (B) + 35 (F) = 98 \u00f7 3 = **32.7**\n\n## Figure 15 Details\n**Fig 15: Example of a block with a contextual setback of 32.7'**\n\nThe diagram shows lots labeled A through H with the following setback measurements:\n- Lot A: 30'\n- Lot B: 33'\n- Lot C: 20' (Flag lot)\n- Lot D: Single Family\n- Lot E: 37'\n- Lot F: 35'\n- Lot G: Multifamily (3+ units)\n- Lot H: 10' (Corner lot facing cross street)\n\n### Key Legend\n- Required setbacks (dashed line)\n- Lot line (solid line)\n- Buildable area (dotted pattern)\n- Sidewalk (light gray)\n- Curb (line)\n- Existing house (black)\n\n**Page number: 21**",
