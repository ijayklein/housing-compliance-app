Extension of existing side yard encroachment\n\nAn existing wall that encroaches into the required interior side yard setback but is at least 5'-0\" from the property line, may be extended at the same setback, in one direction only, at the ground floor only, for a distance equal to the length of the existing wall or 20' whichever is less.\n\n**Note:** In the example below, two existing walls are encroaching--only one of them may be extended.\n\n## B. Extension of existing front yard encroachment\n\nAn existing wall that encroaches into the required front yard setback but is at least 14'-0\" from the property line, may be extended at the same setback, in one direction only, at the ground floor only, with both of the following provisions:\n\n1) the length of the extension is no greater than the length of the existing encroaching wall,\n\n2) the combined length is no greater than one-half the maximum width of the house.\n\n## C. Extension of existing street-side yard encroachment\n\nAn existing wall that encroaches into the required street-side yard setback but is at least 10'-0\" from the property line, may be extended at the same setback, in one direction only, at the ground floor only, for a distance equal to the length of the existing wall or 20' whichever is less.\n\n## Note:\n\u2022 Encroaching walls that don't meet the minimum setback given for each case (5', 14', and 10'), may not be extended nor may they may not be stepped back and then extended.\n\n\u2022 Multiple extensions are not permitted; addition must be contiguous with existing protrusion.\n\n\u2022 Only for structures that were legally constructed, without a variance or an home-improvement exception (HIE).\n\n\u2022 Only once in the life of the structure.\n\n\u2022 Requires retention of the non-complying wall.\n\n\u2022 Exceptions apply to special setbacks as well.\n\n## Key\n- Lot line\n- - - - Required setback\n- Buildable area\n- Sidewalk\n- Existing house\n- Addition\n\n**Page 25**",
