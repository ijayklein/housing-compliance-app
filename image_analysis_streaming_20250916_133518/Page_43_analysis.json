Front-half pattern lots**\n\u2022 lots with garage in front half of the lot (F)\n\n**2. Rear-half pattern lots**\n\u2022 lots with garage in the rear half of the lot (B & D) and\n\u2022 lots with no garage (E) (counts as a rear-pattern lot)\n\nDetermine which pattern category is predominant i.e., into which category more than half of the lots fall.\n\n### Application:\n**Front half** \u2192 [leads to front half designation]\n\n**Rear half** \u2192 The contextual garage placement regulation DOES apply. Projects on this block must place the garage in the rear half of the lot.\n\n## Fig 32: Example of a block on which the contextual garage placement regulation applies\n\n[The image shows a diagram of a city block with lots labeled A through H, showing houses and garages in different positions. The diagram illustrates the application of the contextual garage placement rules described above.]\n\n**Page number: 37**",
