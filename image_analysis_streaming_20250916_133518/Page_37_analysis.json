Combo garage/small pool cabana (side by side)\n\n\u2022 Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n  a. be at least 7.5' from the front lot line\n  b. be no more than 12' high\n  c. comply with accessory structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)\n\n\u2022 Structure is located right at the side lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.\n\n\u2022 Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.\n\n## B. Stand-alone pool cabana\n\n\u2022 Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n  a. be at least 7.5' from the front lot line\n  b. be no more than 12' high\n  c. comply with accessory structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)\n\n\u2022 Structure is located right at the rear lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.\n\n\u2022 Structure has 3 plumbing fixtures \u2013 sink, toilet, and shower and is greater than 200 sf, so it requires a CUP.\n\n## C. Office above garage\n\n\u2022 Structure is located within the buildable area, so it doesn't have to comply with regulations for structures in the required yards and it may be two stories high.\n\n\u2022 Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.\n\n\u2022 Structure is new 2nd floor addition and therefore subject to the Planning Department's Individual Review (IR).\n\n**Note:** Site planning for accessory buildings differs from that for parking structures in one way. A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 7.5' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.\n\n**Note:** Because this structure is 2 stories, it must be located within the buildable area regardless of the distances from the lot lines and is subject to Individual Review (IR)\n\n## Key\n- Curb lot line\n- Sidewalk\n- Required setbacks\n- Buildable area\n- Dwelling/parking\n- Accessory structure\n\n**Page 31**",
