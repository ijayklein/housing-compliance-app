    "raw_content": "Based on the photocopied page from this city planning technical manual, I can extract the following information:\n\n## Step 2: Perimeter Segment Identification\n- **Objective**: Determine which perimeter segments abut the house walls. These are closed segments, or sides.\n- **Reference**: In Fig 5 sides A, B, & C abut the house walls. These are considered to be closed segments.\n\n## Step 3: Facade Status Determination\n- **Rule**: Determine the status (open/closed) of the remaining segments based on the design. If at least 50% of the facade area is open, then the segment or side is considered open.\n\n### For purposes of assessing the openess of the facade:\n\n**Measurement Guidelines:**\n- The height of the segment facades is measured from the top of the porch floor to the point where the segment facade intersects with the top of the roof material.\n- The widths of the segment facades are measured from the same plane. Allowances may be made for structural supports that are not excessive.\n\n### Diagram Specifications:\nThe bottom diagram shows four segments labeled D, E, F, and G with the following measurements:\n\n**Segment D:**\n- Width: 7'\n- Status: Open\n\n**Segment E:**\n- Width: 14'\n- Status: Closed (because of decorative glass wall)\n- Shows \"intersection facade & top of roof material\" with \"Height = 8'\"\n- Shows \"Porch flr\" level\n\n**Segment F:**\n- Width: 24'\n- Status: Open\n\n**Segment G:**\n- Width: 4'\n- Status: Open\n\nThe page number shown is 9.",
