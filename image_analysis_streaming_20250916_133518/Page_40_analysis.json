Therefore, a two-car garage or carport to be 20' x 20' clear inside.\n\n\u2022 Minimum vertical clearance: 7'.\n\n## Additional Requirements\n\n* Clear area for parking space must be free of other uses e.g., water heaters, clothes washers or dryer, bicycle parking facilities, etc.\n\n## Code Sections Referenced\n**Page 34**\n18.12.060, 18.83.090\n\n**Page 35**\n18.83.090, 18.83.110(a)\n\n**Page 36**\n18.12.060\n\n**Page 37**\n18.12.040 (f)\n\n**Page 38**\n18.12.060\n\n**Page 39**\n18.12.080 (b)\n\n## Figure 28 Specifications\nFig 28 Parking space dimensions for garage and uncovered space in plan view\n\n**Dimensions shown in diagram:**\n- 10' min. inside clearance\n- 20' min. inside clearance\n- Required covered space\n- 2nd space (uncovered) Tandem OK\n- 18' min.\n- 8.5' min. uncovered space\n\nPage 34",
