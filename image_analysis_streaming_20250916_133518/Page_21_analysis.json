This may be illustrated by comparing Roof Plans 1 & 2 of Fig 10.\n\n## Fig 10 Balconies\n[Contains an isometric drawing showing a building with balconies, labeled with \"Roof plan 1\" and \"Roof plan 2\" indicators]\n\n## Roof Plan 1\n**Area A:** Counts because it is roofed\n**Area B:** Does not count because this arbor is substantially open\n**Area C:** Does not count because the overhang is the same size as the overhang around the rest of the house and is considered to be open\n\n[Shows plan view with areas A, B, and C marked, with measurements indicating \"Width of overhang over the rest of the house\"]\n\n## Roof Plan 2\n**Area A:** Counts because it is roofed\n**Area B:** Counts because the overhang here is greater than the overhang around the rest of the house, and considered to be roofed\n**Area C:** Does not count because it is open\n\n[Shows plan view with areas A, B, and C marked, with measurements indicating \"Width of overhang around the rest of the house\"]\n\n## Note:\nPop-out balconies are subject to the same evaluation.\n\n**Page number:** 15",
