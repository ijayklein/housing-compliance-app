Five R-1 zones reflect and preserve traditional building patterns and criteria for minimum and maximum lot sizes.\n\n### Min. & max. lot sizes by zone\n\nThe subdivision ordinance requires a new lot to have\nA) width \u2265 60' AND depth \u2265 100' AND\nB) lot area (in sf) per the following:\n\n| Zone District | Minimum | Maximum |\n|---------------|---------|---------|\n| R-1 | 6,000 | 9,999 |\n| R-1(7000) | 7,000 | 13,999 |\n| R-1(8000) | 8,000 | 15,999 |\n| R-1(10000) | 10,000 | 19,999 |\n| R-1(20000) | 20,000 | 39,999 |\n\n### Exceptions to the max. lot size\n\n\u2022 Where underlying lot lines must be removed to eliminate non-conformities and results in no net loss of housing.\n\n\u2022 Where an adjacent substandard lot of less than 25' in width is combined with another lot and results in no net loss of housing.\n\n\u2022 Where the resultant number of lots increases or stays the same and results in no net loss of housing.\n\n## Substandard Lots\n\nEven within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes. Smaller lots that meet the following criteria are considered to be substandard.\n\n### Substandard lot sizes by zone\n\nA substandard lot is one with\nA) width < 50' OR depth < 83' AND\nB) area \u2264 the following (83% of min. lot size):\n\n| Zone District | Typical lot | Flag lot |\n|---------------|-------------|----------|\n| R-1 | 4,980 | 5,976 |\n| R-1(7000) | 5,810 | 6,972 |\n| R-1(8000) | 6,640 | 7,968 |\n| R-1(10000) | 8,300 | 9,960 |\n| R-1(20000) | 16,600 | 19,920 |\n\n### Special regulations for substandard lots\n\n\u2022 Maximum building height is single-story and 17' instead of 30'\n\n\u2022 For lots less than 50' wide, the required street-side yard is 10' instead of 16'. (Fig 15 C on p. 23)\n\n\u2022 For lots less than 95' deep, the requirements for locating a garage in the rear or side yards are that it be in the rear half of the lot instead of 75' back from the front lot line.\n\n## Code Sections\n\n**Page 2**\n18.12.040 (a) Table 2\n18.12.040 (d)\n18.12.040 (e)\n\n**Page 3**\n18.04.030 (a) (85)\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Determining where lot lines are on the ground may require a boundary survey.",
