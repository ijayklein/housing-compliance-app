    "raw_content": "Setback considerations\n\n**Easements**\nSome easements affect setbacks i.e., setbacks must be measured from the edge of the easement regardless of the lot line as illustrated in Fig 16 on this page. Easements that affect setbacks are:\n* Creek easements\n* Public street easements\n\n**Note:** most public utility easements do not affect setbacks.\n\n**Sidewalks**\nThe sidewalk may not indicate the lot line. Often, the street easement or public right-of-way extends for several feet beyond the sidewalk. Fig 16 on this page illustrates this common circumstance and how the setbacks are affected i.e., they must be measured from the lot line regardless of the sidewalk.\n\n**Oddly shaped lots**\nFor some lots, the setbacks and required yards may not be obvious. Fig 17 on page 23 indicates the appropriate site plan for lot shapes about which questions often arise:\n* flag lot (Fig 17 A)\n* corner lot (Fig 17 B)\n* through lot (Fig 17 D)\n* wedge-shaped lot (Fig 17 E)\n* lot with more than four sides (Fig 17 F & G)\n\n**Flag & substandard lots**\nFig 17 on page 23 also illustrates examples of setbacks that have been reduced for smaller or oddly shaped lots e.g.,\n* the front setback of a flag lot (Fig 17 A)\n* the street-side yard setback for substandard corner lots that are less than 50' wide (Fig 17 C)\n\n**Fig 16 Setbacks: easements and sidewalks**\n\n**(Diagram Description)**\nThe diagram shows a plot of land with a \"Buildable area\" in the center. Surrounding the buildable area are \"Rear yard\", \"Interior-side yard\" (on both sides), and \"Front yard\".\nAbove the rear yard, there is an \"Easement\" labeled \"Creek or public access easement e.g., street or alley\".\nBelow the front yard, there is a \"Sidewalk\" and a \"Curb\".\n\n**Labels and Notes within the Diagram:**\n*   **Easement:** Creek or public access easement e.g., street or alley.\n*   **Setbacks are measured from easement regardless of where the lot lines are located.** (See section on Lot Size for more information about creek easements).\n*   **Setbacks are measured from the lot lines regardless of where the sidewalks are located.** (Note if the lot line is in the middle of the street, then the setback is measured from the edge of the public street easement or right-of-way. (See section on Lot Size for more information about public street easements.)\n*   **Note:** The space between the sidewalk edge and the lot line is part of the public right of way. It may be 0' or more than 15'. Please ask at the Development Center.\n\n**Key**\n*   Curb (solid line)\n*   Lot line (dashed line)\n*   Sidewalk (pattern of small squares)\n*   Required setbacks (thicker solid line)\n*   Buildable area (shaded grey area)\n*   Easement (diagonal lines)\n\n**Note:** For information regarding creek easements, contact the Santa Clara Valley Water District\n\nPage number: 22",
