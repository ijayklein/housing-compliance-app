Structures located in the rear and/or side yards are regulated by the accessory-structure daylight plan described on the next page.\n\n**Figure Caption:**\nFig 20 Front elevation showing side primary daylight plane\n\n**Code Sections:**\n*   Page 26: 18.12.040 (a) Table 2\n*   Page 27: 18.04\n*   Page 28: 18.12.040 (c) Table 2\n*   Page 29: 18.12.050 (b) (2), 18.12.040 (j)\n\n**Diagram Labels and Specifications:**\n*   **Side lot line**\n*   **10' from average grade**\n*   **45\u00b0** (angle of the daylight plane)\n*   **Max. allowed is Min. required by Building Code** (pointing to a vertical dimension)\n*   **24' max. for protrusions** (vertical dimension from grade)\n*   **Max. building height** (vertical dimension from grade)\n*   **Average grade**\n*   **Grade at the nearest point on the adjacent lot**\n*   **Existing grade of the structure (at midpoint of wall)**\n\n**Notes:**\n*   Daylight plane is measured from average grade.\n*   Average grade is established using existing grade\u2014before any grading or fill (See Fig 44 p. 42).\n*   Side daylight plane is measured (up) at lot line.\n*   Rear daylight plane is measured (up) at rear setback.\n\n**Page Number:** 26",
