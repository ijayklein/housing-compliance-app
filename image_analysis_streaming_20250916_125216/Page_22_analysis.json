The 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency addresses how these areas count toward the gross floor area.\n\n**In Fig 11 below, the highlighted areas count as follows:**\n*   **Area A** of this 3rd floor (accessible via stairs), has 5' of head clearance and counts as 3rd floor area.\n*   **Area B** of this 2nd floor (accessible via stairs), has 5' of head clearance and is included in the count of the, more obvious, 2nd floor area.\n\n**Note:** 500 sf of unusable attic space may be exempted for Category 1 & 2 historic homes.\n\n**Fig 11 Attic, closet, & perimeter spaces**\n\n**Note:** Measurements are from top of floor to underside of the rafter\n\n**Code sections**\n18.04.030(a)(65)\n18.12.040(b)Table 3\n\n**Diagram elements:**\n*   A cross-section of a building showing a 1st floor, a 2nd floor, and an attic space.\n*   Area A is highlighted in the attic space.\n*   Area B is highlighted on the 2nd floor, near the perimeter.\n*   A dimension line indicates a 5' head clearance.\n*   Labels include \"1st floor\", \"oor\", \"Underside of pical)\", and \"CC\".\n*   The number 16 is at the bottom left of the page.",
