    "raw_content": "**Accessory structures site planning**\n\n**Note:** Site planning for accessory buildings differs from that for parking structures in one way. A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 75' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.\n\n**Fig 24 Examples of site planning solutions for accessory structures**\n\n**A Combo garage /small pool cabana (side by side)**\n* Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n    a. be at least 75' from the front lot line\n    b. be no more than 12' high\n    c. comply with accessory-structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)\n* Structure is located right at the side lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.\n* Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.\n\n**B Stand-alone pool cabana**\n* Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n    a. be at least 75' from the front lot line\n    b. be no more than 12' high\n    c. comply with accessory-structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)\n* Structure is located right at the rear lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.\n* Structure has 3 plumbing fixtures\u2014 sink, toilet, and shower and is greater than 200 sf, so it requires a CUP.\n\n**C Office above garage**\n* Structure is located within the buildable area, so it doesn't have to comply with regulations for structures in the required yards and it may be two stories high.\n* Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.\n* Structure is new 2nd floor addition and therefore subject to the Planning Department's Individual Review (IR).\n\n**Note:** Because this structure is 2 stories, it must be located within the buildable area regardless of the distances from the lot lines and is subject to Individual Review (IR).\n\n**Key**\n* **Curb** (solid black line)\n* **Lot line** (thin black line)\n* **Sidewalk** (patterned grey rectangle)\n* **Required setbacks** (dashed black line)\n* **Buildable area** (light grey shaded area)\n* **Dwelling/parking** (dark grey shaded area)\n* **Accessory structure** (black shaded area)\n\n**Diagrams:**\n\n**Interior lot example (A Combo garage /small pool cabana)**\n* Shows a \"Combo garage/small pool house\" in the rear yard.\n* \"Min. 75'\" setback from the front lot line to the accessory structure.\n* The accessory structure is located at the interior-side yard line.\n* \"Main dwelling\" is in the front part of the lot.\n* \"Front yard\" is indicated.\n* \"Rear yard\" is indicated.\n\n**Interior lot example (B Stand-alone pool cabana)**\n* Shows a \"Larger pool cabana\" in the rear yard.\n* \"Min. 75'\" setback from the front lot line to the accessory structure.\n* The accessory structure is located at the rear yard line.\n* \"Main dwelling\" is in the front part of the lot with a \"2-car attached garage\".\n* \"Front yard\" is indicated.\n* \"Rear yard\" is indicated.\n\n**Corner lot example (C Office above garage)**\n* Shows an \"Office above garage\" structure.\n* \"3' min.\" setback from the street-side yard line.\n* \"Main dwelling\" is in the front part of the lot.\n* \"Front yard\" is indicated.\n* \"Rear yard\" is indicated.\n* \"Street-side yard\" is indicated.\n* \"Interior-side yard\" is indicated.\n\n**Page Number:** 31",
