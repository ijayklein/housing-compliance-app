    "raw_content": "Here's the extracted information from the image, focusing on crucial zoning rules, regulations, and technical specifications with absolute precision:\n\n**Title:** 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\n\n**Rule/Regulation:**\nAreas higher than 17' and 26' above the first floor (that do not already count as floor area e.g., open atrium spaces and inaccessible attic spaces), count toward the gross floor area in the form of 2nd and 3rd floor equivalency regardless of the floor plan or usage of the space. Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured.\n\n**Note:** 200 sf of 3rd floor equivalency may be exempted where roof pitch is 4:12 or steeper (see \"Height\" section).\n\n**Examples of how highlighted areas count (from Fig 12):**\n\n**Area A:**\n*   once as 1st floor,\n*   again as 2nd floor, and\n*   a third time as 3rd-floor equivalency\n\n**Area B:**\n*   once as 1st floor,\n*   again as 2nd-floor equivalency\n\n**Figure Title:** Fig 12 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\n\n**Technical Specifications/Labels from Diagrams:**\n\n**Diagram 1 (Left):**\n*   \"Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the uppermost hatched area)\n*   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the middle hatched area)\n*   \"26'\" (indicating a height level)\n*   \"Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\" (label for the uppermost hatched area)\n*   \"Top of roof material (Typical)\" (pointing to the roof line at 26' level)\n*   \"17'\" (indicating a height level)\n*   \"Top of roof material (Typical)\" (pointing to the roof line at 17' level)\n*   \"A\" (label for a hatched area)\n*   \"B\" (label for a hatched area including stairs)\n*   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd floor\" (pointing to the hatched area labeled 'A')\n*   \"1st flr\" (label for the ground floor level)\n*   \"Top of finished floor (Typical)\" (pointing to the ground floor level)\n\n**Diagram 2 (Right):**\n*   \"Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the uppermost hatched area)\n*   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the middle hatched area)\n*   \"26'\" (indicating a height level)\n*   \"Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\" (label for the uppermost hatched area)\n*   \"17'\" (indicating a height level)\n*   \"A\" (label for a hatched area)\n*   \"B\" (label for a hatched area)\n*   \"Vaulted ceiling space\" (label for a hatched area)\n*   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd floor\" (pointing to the hatched area labeled 'A')\n*   \"1st fl\" (label for the ground floor level)\n\n**Page Number:** 17",
