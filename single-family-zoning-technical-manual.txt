includes illustrations, terms, deﬁnitions, and other technical information to provide for the consistent application of the zoning ordinance. The technical manual also includes supporting documents to indicate the underlying intent and basis for many of the zoning ordinance provisions. The technical manual is not a comprehensive represen.tation of, nor a substitute for, any chapter in the Munici.pal Code. It is meant to be a helpful supplement and to be used in conjunction with the Municipal Code. In the event of any perceived conﬂict between the te.chinical manual and the Municipal Code, the provisions of the Municipal Code shall prevail. Lot size The characteristics of a lot determine its devel.opment potential and chief among these char.acteristics is the area of the lot. For example, to as.sure continuity in the appearance of the streetscape throughout our neighborhoods and city,  the allowable building size is based on a percentage of the lot area. Code sections Page 2 18.12.040 (a) Table 2 18.12.040 (d) 18.12.040 (c) Page 3 18.04.030 (a) (85) Minimum & maximum lot sizes As Palo Alto developed and grew through annexation, each subdivision evolved with unique characteristics e.g., the size of the lots within the subdivision. Five R-1 zones reﬂ ect and preserve traditional lotting patterns with criteria for minimum and maximum lot sizes. Min. & max. lot sizes by zone .................................................... ......... ≥................. ≥.......... ........................................ .............  .......  .......  ...  .....  .....  .........  .....  ......  .........  .....  ......  ..........  ......  ......  ..........  ......  ......  Exceptions to the max. lot size • Where underlying lot lines must be removed to elimi.nate non-conformities and results in no net loss of housing. • Where an adjacent substandard lot of less than 25’ in width is combined with another lot and results in no net loss of housing. • Where the resultant number of lots increases or stays the same and results in no net loss of housing. Substandard lots Even within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes. Smaller lots that meet the following criteria are considered to be substandard. Substandard lot sizes by zone A sub-standard lot is one with A) width < 50' OR depth < 83' AND B) area . the following (83% of min. lot size): Zone District  Typical lot  Flag lot  R-1  4,980  5,976  R-1(7000)  5,810  6,972  R-1(8000)  6,640  7,968  R-1(10000)  8,300  9,960  R-1(20000)  16,600  19,920  Special regulations for substandard lots • Maximum building height is single-story and 17’ instead of 30’ • For lots less than 50’ wide, the required street-sid yard is 10’ instead of 16’. (Fig 15 C on p. 23) • For lots less than 95’ deep, the requirements for locat.ing a garage in the rear or side yards are that it be in the rear half of the lot instead of 75’ back from the front lot line. Note: Determining where lot lines are on the ground may require a boundary survey. Gross vs. net lot area Gross lot area is the size of the lot—from lot line to lot line. Development potential is based on the net lot area and while gross and net lot area are the same for most lots in Palo Alto, there are some lots for which portions must be excluded from the gross lot area to establish the net lot area. Areas excluded from the gross lot size are: • Street right-of-way (Area A of Fig 1 on this page) • “Pole” portion of a ﬂ ag lot (Area B of Fig 2 on this page) • Creek channel (Area C of Fig 3 on this page) Fig 1 Gross lot area exclusions: street easements ......... ........... ............ ......... .......... Fig 2 Gross lot area exclusions: ﬂog-lot “poles” ......... ............. ........ ........ ........................ ............................ ....................... ............................... ............................... ............................. ................................. ...... Lot coverage & floor area These terms are used to describe the amount of development on a lot. Lot coverage describes how much of the lot is covered by structures but doesn’t evaluate the mass of those structures. Gross ﬂoor area describes the mass of the structures by reﬂecting the cumulative square footage of all visible levels. Code sections Page 4—5 18.12.040 (a) Table 2 18.12.040 (b) Table 3 18.04.030 (a) (86) Lot coverage Maximum allowable Allowable lot coverage is expressed by a ratio—35% of the lot size. Example calculation: .................................. ...................... ............................ Lot coverage includes: • footprints of all structures including main resi.dence, covered parking, tool sheds, covered pool equipment units, etc. • projecting elements such as balconies, stairways, porches, patio covers, etc. • decking that exceeds 30” above grade. • for roof overhangs or eaves that exceed 4’, the por.tion that is beyond 4’. • swimming pools and spas that exceed 30” above grade. Lot coverage excludes: • roof overhangs up to 4’. • uncovered structures less than 30” above grade. An additional 5% coverage is permitted for covered patios, canopies and roof overhangs beyond 4 feet. Note: To qualify as a structure that is less than 30 inches above grade, a porch or deck may only have open railings above 30 inches—no solid half walls. Gross Floor area Maximum allowable Allowable gross ﬂ oor area is expressed by a ratio—the sum of 45% of the ﬁ rst 5,000 sf of lot area plus 30% of any portion of lot area in excess of 5,000 sf. Example calculation: .................................. .......................... .............................. ............................... ..... ............ Gross ﬂoor area includes: • the sum of all the ﬂ oors in a main structure mea.sured to the outside of the exterior stud walls. • stairwells at all ﬂ oors and all areas that are greater than 50% enclosed and covered. • covered parking and all accessory buildings which are greater than 120 square feet. • spaces that meet the criteria for second and third ﬂ oor equivalents. What counts as ﬂoor area summary ..................... ....... ............ ........................ .................. ..

Non-roofed porches, entryways, balconies etc. • Non-roofed features generally do not count 2. Roofed porches on the 1st ﬂoor (Fig 4 A & D on p. 7 , Fig 5 on p. 8) • Openess of the sides determines whether or not these count regardless of the height. • If they do count, they count only once. 3. that are less than 12’ high (from grade) (Fig 4 B on p. 7) • These count once regardless of the design including openess. 4. Roofed high from grade—”vaulted entry feature” (Fig 4 C & D on p. 7, Fig 6, 7, & 8 on pp. 11-13) • These count twice regardless of the design including openess. 5. Recessed porches on the 1st ﬂoor (Fig 9 on p. 14) • Height, depth, & openess determine whether or not these count. • If they count and are less than 17’ high, they count only once. • If they count and are more than 17’ high, they count twice. 6. Roofed balconies/outdoor areas on upper ﬂoors (Fig 10 on p. 15 ) • These count once regardless of the design including openess Difference between a porch & an entry feature: A feature is considered to be a porch rather than an entry feature if it can clearly accomodate more activities than entering and leaving the house. The following pages address the details of assessing these features with regard to gross ﬂoor area. Fig 4 Types of porches and entry ways A Roofed porch C Vaulted entry way Roofed porches on the 1st ﬂoor Roofed porches on the 1st ﬂoor do NOT count toward the gross ﬂoor area if at least 50% of the perimeter is at least 50% open. How to determine if a porch is at least 50% open (using Fig 5 as an example) Step 1: Determine the perimeter of the porch and divide it into segments that will allow a comparison of closed and open segments. The perimeter of the porch in Fig 5 is shown below. It is the sum of segments AA throug G. It is 70 linear feet. D F Step 2: Determine which perimeter segments abut the house walls. These are closed segments, or sides. In Fig 5 sides A, B, & C abut the house walls. These are considered to be closed segments. Step 3: Determine the status (open/closed) of the remaining segments based on the design. If at least 50% of the facade area is open, then the segment or side is considered open. For purposes of assessing the openess of the facade: • The height of the segment facades is measured from the top of the porch ﬂoor to the the point where the segment facade intersects with the top of the roof material. • The widths of the segment facades are measured from the same plane. Allowances may be made for structural supports that are not excessive. ............. ............. ................ ......... ... ... .... ...... .... .... .................................. Step 4: Finalize the determination of which segments are closed and which are open, total the linear feet in each category, and compare the totals. ............... For the porch in Fig 5, the summary is as follows: ............. ...... .... ....... Feet ....... Feet . .. . .. . .. . ... . ... . .. ... ... Conclusion: The perimeter of the porch in Fig 5 is 50% open and so the porch would NOT count toward gross ﬂoor area Note: If a porch ﬂoor is more than 30” above grade, the porch sides may need to be 36” high for safety reasons. This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right: • Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls. • A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls. .... .... Vaulted entry features Entry features that are greater than 12’ high are called “vaulted entry features”. The footprint of such features count twice toward gross ﬂoor area regardless of the design (including whether or not they are open) . How to measure the height of an entry feature in order to determine whether or not it is considered to be a vaulted entry feature (using Fig 6 - 8 as examples) Fig 6 Entry feature with shed roof ...................... .................. .............. ............................................................. .................................... ........................................................... ........................................................ ................. .............................................................. ............ .................................................. .................. ........ .................... ....................... ..................... ........ .............. .............. ................ Fig 7 Entry feature with gabled roof ............................................................. .................................... ........................................................... ........................................................ ................. .............................................................. ............ .................................................. .................. ........ .................... ....................... ..................... ........ .............. .............. ................ Fig 8 Entry feature with 2nd ﬂoor above Note: The 2nd ﬂoor over a vaulted entry will count as usual. Therefore, the area will count three times toward gross ﬂoor area. ............................................................. .................................... ........................................................... ........................................................ ................. .............................................................. ............ .................................................. .................... ....................... ..................... ........ ................ ................... .............. .............. ................ Recessed porches on the 1st ﬂoor Height, depth, and openess of a recessed porch determine whether or not it counts toward gross ﬂoor area. Recessed porches on the ground ﬂoor do NOT count toward gross ﬂoor area if ALL the following criteria apply: • Depth of porch is less than 10’ and, • Porch ceiling is below 2nd ﬂoor and, • Exterior side is substantially open. Fig 9 Recessed porches on the 1st ﬂoor Note: It is the city’s policy to consider one-story construction to be construction less than 17’ above ﬁnished ﬂoor. If the porch space is higher, the area will count again as 2nd story equivalency. Balconies, decks, & outdoor areas on upper ﬂoors Outdoor areas on upper levels that are roofed DO count toward gross ﬂoor area regardless of the design (including whether or not the sides are open).      An outdoor area on an upper ﬂoor is considered to be ........ ........................... roofed if the eave over that area is deeper than the eave ........... ........ ....................................................... over the rest of the building.

The 2nd & 3rd ﬂoor equivalency addresses how these areas count toward the gross ﬂoor area. Code sections 18.04.030(a)(65) 18.12.040(b)Table 3 In Fig 11 below, the highlighted areas count as follows: • Area A of this 3rd ﬂoor (accessible via stairs), has 5’ of head clearance and counts as 3rd ﬂoor area. • Area B of this 2rd ﬂoor (accessible via stairs), has 5’ of head clearance and is included in the count of the, more obvious, 2nd ﬂoor area. ................... .................... Attic, closet, & perimeter spaces On all accessible ﬂoors, areas with at least 5’ of head clearance count toward the gross .......... .................ﬂoor area regardless of the ﬂoor plan or actual usage of the space.2nd & 3rd ﬂoor equivalency Areas higher than 17’ and 26’ above the ﬁrst ﬂoor (that do not already count as ﬂoor area e.g., open atrium spaces and inaccessible attic spaces), count toward the gross ﬂoor area in the form of 2nd and 3rd ﬂoor equiva.lency regardless of the ﬂoor plan or usage of the space. Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured. In the examples of Fig 12 below the highlighted areas count as follows: Note: 200 sf of 3rd ﬂoor equivalency may beArea BArea A • once as 1st ﬂoor, • once as 1st ﬂoor, exempted where roof pitch is 4:12 or steeper • again as 2nd ﬂoor, and • again as 2nd-ﬂoor equivalency (see “Height” section). • a third time as 3rd-ﬂoor equivalency Fig 12 2nd & 3rd ﬂoor equivalency ................... ................... .................... .................... ........... ......................... .............. ............... ............... .......... .................................. ..................... ......... I............ ............. ...... ...... ........................ ............ ................. ........ ......... ........ ........ ..... ....... .............................................................................. ................... ......... ....... Projections Architectural relief features such as bay windows are pleasant additions to a house design and are encouraged. If they meet certain design criteria they do not count toward gross ﬂoor area. Code sections 18.04.030(a)(65) 18.12.040(b)Table 3 Bay windows Bay windows that meet the design criteria below are considered to be decorative architectural features and do NOT count toward gross ﬂoor area. Design criteria for bay windows that do not count: • Bottom of feature must be at least 18” above the ﬂoor joists Note: Bay windows that ex.• Exterior supports must be features like corbels and/or brackets tend higher than the struc.rather than solid walls ture’s roof are considered • At least 50% of the surface is glass to be dormers and count to.ward gross ﬂoor area. Fig 13 Bay windows ........................ ........ ..................................... .................... Fireplaces, chimneys, sheds, planters, and other projections • Fireplaces shall be included in the gross ﬂoor area (counted one time) regardless of conﬁgura.tion or design. • Sheds, planters, and other projections that are higher than 5’ count toward gross ﬂoor area regardless of conﬁguration or design.  Fig 14 Fireplaces, chimneys, sheds, etc. Note: In 2000, the city of Palo Alto ......................................................... ..................................................... .................................... Setbacks Setbacks apportion a lot into two parts: • buildable area (in the middle) • required yards (surrounding the building area). These required yards, meant to be maintained as open space areas, are important as landscaping opportunities to keep our neighborhoods attractive as well as for the preser.vation of privacy. Code sections Page 20 18.12.040 (a) Table 2 18.12.040 (a,c,e,& i) Page 21 18.04.040 (e) Page 22—23 18.040.030 (84, 87, 91, 128, & 146) Page 24—25 as shown in table Standard setbacks Standard setbacks apply in most cases. Standard setbacks by zone For front setback, if contextual setback is greater than 30’ then it applies—otherwise, the 20’ setback applies. For front & street side setbacks a special setback may apply.

Easements that affect setbacks are: • Creek easements • Public street easements Note: most public utility easements do not affect setbacks. Sidewalks The sidewalk may not indicate the lot line.
