## Title
* Gross vs. net lot area

## Body text
* Gross lot area is the size of the lot—from lot line to lot line. Development potential is based on the net lot area and while gross and net lot area are the same for most lots in Palo Alto, there are some lots for which portions must be excluded from the gross lot area to establish the net lot area.

Areas excluded from the gross lot size are:
* Street right-of-way (Area A of **Figure 1** on this page)
* “Pole” portion of a flag lot (Area B of **Figure 2** on this page)
* Creek channel (Area C of **Figure 3** on this page)

**Figure 1** Gross lot area exclusions: street easements
* Labels/text shown in the figure:
* Lot with boundaries that extend into the public ROW
* The portion of the lot within the public ROW must be subtracted from the gross lot area.
* Notes In some areas of Palo Alto, like Barron Park, it is not unusual for the lot to extend to the middle of the street. However for lot area purposes, the lot is defined by the edge of the public street easement or public right-of-way (ROW). Dimensions for the public ROW are available at the Development Center
