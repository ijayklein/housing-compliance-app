## Main body
* Porch types
* For purposes of assessing gross floor area, porches, entryways, and balconies fall into one of these categories:

1. Non-roofed porches, entryways, balconies etc.
 • Non-roofed features generally do not count

2. Roofed porches on the 1st floor (**Figure 4** A & D on p. 7 , **Figure 5** on p. 8)
 • Openness of the sides determines whether or not these count regardless of the height.
 • If they do count, they count only once.

3. Roofed entry features on the 1st floor that are less than 12' high (from grade) (**Figure 4** B on p. 7)
 • These count once regardless of the design including openess.

4. Roofed entry features on the 1st floor that are more than 12' high from grade – “vaulted entry feature” (**Figure 4** C & D on p. 7, **Figure 6**, 7, & 8 on pp. 11-13)
 • These count twice regardless of the design including openess.

5. Recessed porches on the 1st floor (**Figure 9** on p. 14)
 • Height, depth, & openess determine whether or not these count.
 • If they count and are less than 17' high, they count only once.
 • If they count and are more than 17' high, they count twice.

6. Roofed balconies/outdoor areas on upper floors (**Figure 10** on p. 15)
 • These count once regardless of the design including openess

Right-side callout box
* Difference between a porch & an entry feature:
 A feature is considered to be a porch rather than an entry feature if it can clearly accomodate more activities than entering and leaving the house.

## Footer note
