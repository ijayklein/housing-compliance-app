Section: Lot size
* The characteristics of a lot determine its development potential and chief among these characteristics is the area of the lot.
* For example, to assure continuity in the appearance of the streetscape throughout our neighborhoods and city, the allowable building size is based on a percentage of the lot area.

Section: Minimum & maximum lot sizes
* As Palo Alto developed and grew through annexation, each subdivision evolved with unique characteristics e.g., the size of the lots within the subdivision. Five R-1 zones reflect and preserve traditional lotting patterns with criteria for minimum and maximum lot sizes.

Min. & max. lot sizes by zone
* The subdivision ordinance requires a new lot to have:
 A) width ≥ 60' AND depth ≥ 100' AND
 B) lot area (in sf) per the following:
* Zone District R-1: Minimum 6,000; Maximum 9,999
* Zone District R-1(7000): Minimum 7,000; Maximum 13,999
* Zone District R-1(8000): Minimum 8,000; Maximum 15,999
* Zone District R-1(10000): Minimum 10,000; Maximum 19,999
* Zone District R-1(20000): Minimum 20,000; Maximum 39,999

Exceptions to the max. lot size
* Where underlying lot lines must be removed to eliminate non-conformities and results in no net loss of housing.
* Where an adjacent substandard lot of less than 25' in width is combined with another lot and results in no net loss of housing.
* Where the resultant number of lots increases or stays the same and results in no net loss of housing.

Section: Substandard lots
* Even within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes. Smaller lots that meet the following criteria are considered to be substandard.

## Substandard lot sizes by zone
* A substandard lot is one with:
 A) width < 50' OR depth < 83' AND
 B) area ≤ the following (83% of min. lot size):
* Zone District R-1: Typical lot 4,980; Flag lot 5,976
* Zone District R-1(7000): Typical lot 5,810; Flag lot 6,972
* Zone District R-1(8000): Typical lot 6,640; Flag lot 7,968
* Zone District R-1(10000): Typical lot 8,300; Flag lot 9,960
* Zone District R-1(20000): Typical lot 16,600; Flag lot 19,920

## Special regulations for substandard lots
* Maximum building height is single-story and 17' instead of 30'.
* For lots less than 50' wide, the required street-side yard is 10' instead of 16'. (**Figure 15** C on p. 23)
* For lots less than 95' deep, the requirements for locating a garage in the rear or side yards are that it be in the rear half of the lot instead of 75' back from the front lot line.

Note: Determining where lot lines are on the ground may require a boundary survey.
