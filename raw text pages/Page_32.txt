* Text: The daylight plane in conjunction with the setbacks & height limits, create an invisible tent intended to contain development on the lot in a way that preserves privacy and exposure to natural light.

## Main header
* Primary daylight plane (sides)

## Gray box statement
* The primary daylight plane regulates structures located within the buildable area. Structures located in the rear and/or side yards are regulated by the accessory-structure daylight plan described on the next page.

## Figure caption
* **Figure 20** Front elevation showing side primary daylight plane

## Diagram labels and callouts
* 45°
* 10' from average grade
* Side lot line (appears at both side boundaries)
* Max. allowed is [regulated] by Building Code [word “regulated” inferred by visibility; the rest “by Building Code” legible; if “regulated” is not exact, this callout is [unclear]]
* Average grade
* Grade at the nearest point on the adjacent lot
* Existing grade of the structure (at midpoint of wall)
* 24' max. for portions [unclear remainder of this note]
* Max. building height (with star symbol)

Notes (bullet list beneath figure)
* Daylight plane is measured from average grade.
* Average grade is established using existing grade—before any grading or fill (See **Figure 44** p. 42)
* Side daylight plane is measured (up) at lot line.
* Rear daylight plane is measured (up) at rear setback.

## Footer
* 26

## Items requiring a clearer image to confirm precisely
* The complete text of the callout beginning “Max. allowed is … by Building Code” (the middle word(s) are fuzzy).
* The complete text following “24' max. for portions …” on the right side of the diagram.
