## Title
* Accessory structures site planning

## Figure label
* **Figure 24** Examples of site planning solutions for accessory structures

Section A: Combo garage / small pool cabana (side by side)
* Structure is located in rear yard so it must:
 a. be at least 75' from the front lot line
 b. be no more than 12' high
 c. comply with accessory structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)
* Structure is located right at the side lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.
* Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.

Section B: Stand-alone pool cabana
* Structure is located in rear yard so it must:
 a. be at least 75' from the front lot line
 b. be no more than 12' high
 c. comply with accessory structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)
* Structure is located right at the rear lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.
* Structure has 3 plumbing fixtures â€” sink, toilet, and shower and is greater than 200 sf, so it requires a CUP.

Section C: Office above garage
* Structure is located within the buildable area, so it doesn't have to comply with regulations for structures in the required yards and it may be two stories high.
* Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.
* Structure is new 2nd floor addition and therefore subject to the Planning Department's Individual Review (IR).

## General notes on the page
* Note: Site planning for accessory buildings differs from that for parking structures in one way. A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 75' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.
* Note (near Section C diagram): Because this structure is 2 stories, it must be located within the buildable area regardless of the distances from the lot lines and is subject to Individual Review (IR).
