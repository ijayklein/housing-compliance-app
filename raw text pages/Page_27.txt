## Title
* Contextual front setbacks

Primary rule (boxed)
* Contextual setbacks apply if, and only if, the average of the existing setbacks on the same side of the block is 30' or greater.

## Process header
* How to determine if a contextual setback applies using **Figure 15** below, as an example.

Decision/steps (flowchart text)
* Does block have more than 3 lots? (incl project lot)
* Note: If block is more than 600' long, consider only lots within 600' (max. 10 lots).
* Yes Exclude the following types of lots:
 • Flag lot (C)
 • Multi-family use w/ 3+ units (G)
 • Corner lot facing cross street (H)
* Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?
* Yes Exclude the smallest and largest setbacks:
 • Smallest (D)
 • Largest (E)
 Find the average of the remaining lots (incl. subject lot). If greater than 30', it applies.

Numerical example (callout at right of flow)
* 30 (A)
* 33 (B)
* + 35 (F)
* 98 ÷ 3 = 32.7

## Figure caption
* **Figure 15** Example of a block with a contextual setback of 32.7'

Lots shown in **Figure 15** (A–H) with legible labels/notes
* A: Single-Family. Setback label: 30'
* B: Single-Family. Setback label: 33'
* C: Flag lot (labeled “Flag lot”). Excluded in process.
* D: Single Family. Setback label: 29'. Excluded as “Smallest (D)”.
* E: Single Family. Setback label: 37'. Excluded as “Largest (E)”.
* F: Single-Family. Setback label: 35'
* G: Multiple Family (3+ units). Excluded in process. (A numerical setback label may be present but is not clearly legible in the image.)
* H: Corner lot facing other street. Excluded in process. Adjacent note: “Street sideyard”. (Any numeric dimension adjacent to this lot is not clearly legible in the image.)

## Notes on legibility
* All text above is transcribed exactly where legible. Any measurements for lots G and H are not clearly readable in the provided image and are therefore not reported.
