* **Figure 19** Allowable extensions of existing walls that encroach into required yards (on ground floor only)

Section A — Extension of existing side yard encroachment
* An existing wall that encroaches into the required interior side yard setback but is at least 5'-0" from the property line, may be extended at the same setback, in one direction only, at the ground floor only, for a distance equal to the length of the existing wall or 20' whichever is less.
* Note: In the example below, two existing walls are encroaching—only one of them may be extended.

Section B — Extension of existing front yard encroachment
* An existing wall that encroaches into the required front yard setback but is at least 14'-0" from the property line, may be extended at the same setback, in one direction only, at the ground floor only, with both of the following provisions:
 1) the length of the extension is no greater than that of the existing encroaching wall,
 2) the combined length is no greater than one-half the maximum width of the house.

Section C — Extension of existing street-side yard encroachment
* An existing wall that encroaches into the required street side yard setback but is at least 10'-0" from the property line, may be extended at the same setback, in one direction only, at the ground floor only, for a distance equal to the length of the existing wall or 20' whichever is less.

Note (bulleted list exactly as shown)
* Encroaching walls that don’t meet the minimum setback given for each case i.e., 5’, 14’, and 10’, may not be extended nor may they may not be stepped back and then extended.
* Multiple protrusions are not permitted; addition must be contiguous with existing protrusion.
* Only for structures that were legally constructed, without a variance or an homeimprovement exception (HIE).
* Only once in the life of the structure.
* Requires retention of the non-complying wall.
* Exceptions apply to special setbacks as well.
