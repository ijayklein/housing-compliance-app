* Detached garages/carports site planning

Body bullets (verbatim as readable)
* Detached garages and carports may be located in the rear or interior side yard if at least 75' from the front lot line and at least 20' from the street-side lot line.
* Additionally, on lots less than 95' deep, they may be located in rear or interior side yards if placed in rear half of the lot.
* Garages and carports that take advantage of this setback exception are subject to a stricter daylight plane. See Figs 25–26 p. 32.

Right-side boxed note
* Note: Uncovered spaces must be located beyond the required front-yard and beyond the first 10' of the street-side yard.

## Figure block
* **Figure 34** Examples of site planning solutions for detached garages/carports

## Small note above figures
* Note: In all the examples on this page, a 1-car garage could be substituted for a 2-car garage because there is room for uncovered parking in the driveway.

## Notes on legibility
* The vertical text near the side-yard line is only partially readable (“within 75' or midpoint for lots < 95' deep”); remaining characters are unclear in the image.
* The small label inside the left and right black garage boxes appears to read “2-car Garage w/ fire-rated walls,” but only “w/ … walls” is fully legible; full phrase is inferred from the adjacent UBC callout.
