* **Figure 8** Entry feature with 2nd floor above

## Large note box
* Note: The 2nd floor over a vaulted entry will count as usual. Therefore, the area will count three times toward gross floor area.

## Notes paragraph
* Note: If the entryway is considered to be a vaulted entryway the area will be counted as follows:
 • In this example, a portion of the entryway is recessed beyond the house facade and roof. It is included in the area that counts.
 • The area is measured to the outside material of the entry-way feature.
 • The area counts TWICE toward gross floor area.
