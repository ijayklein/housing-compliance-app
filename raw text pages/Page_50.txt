Sidebar heading: 2nd dwelling units

Sidebar text:
Some lots are large enough to accommodate a 2nd dwelling unit and still maintain the low density that is appropriate for single-family neighborhoods. These units provide for a variety to the City’s housing stock and additional affordable housing opportunities.

• Except on corner lots, entrance way shall not face same lot line as entrance to main dwelling.
• Exterior staircases to 2nd floor units shall be located toward interior side or rear yard.

Parking note:
Parking for 2nd dwelling units is treated the same as parking for the main residence. See “Site planning for attached garages/carports” and “Site planning for detached garages/carports” in the “Parking” section of this manual. Note that parking for the 2nd dwelling unit may be combined with parking for the main residence e.g., a two-car garage as shown in **Figure 23** C & D.
