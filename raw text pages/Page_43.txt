## Contextual garage placement

Applicability
* Contextual garage placement applies if, and only if, there is a predominant neighborhood pattern.

How to determine if it applies (using Fig. 32 as an example)
* Note:
* If block is more than 600' long, consider only lots within 600' or the 10 lots closest to the subject lot.
* If subject lot is a corner lot, consider the pattern on the street that the subject garage faces.

## Steps
1) Exclude the following types of lots:
* Flag lot (C)
* Multi-family use of 3+ units (G)
* Corner lots (A & H)

 The remaining lots, including the subject lot, contribute to the determination.

2) Divide the remaining lots (including the subject lot) into two categories:
* Front-half pattern lots
* lots with garage in front half of the lot (F)
* Rear-half pattern lots
* lots with garage in the rear half of the lot (B & D) and
* lots with no garage (E) [counts as a rear-pattern lot]

3) Determine which pattern category is predominant, i.e., into which category more than half of the lots fall.

## Result shown on page
* Rear half: The contextual garage placement regulation DOES apply. Projects on this block must place the garage in the rear half of the lot.
