* Page title: Balconies, decks, & outdoor areas on upper floors
* Banner statement: Outdoor areas on upper levels that are roofed DO count toward gross floor area regardless of the design (including whether or not the sides are open).
* Explanatory paragraph: An outdoor area on an upper floor is considered to be roofed if the eave over that area is deeper than the eave over the rest of the building. This may be illustrated by comparing Roof Plans 1 & 2 of **Figure 10**.
* Figure label under perspective drawing: **Figure 10** Balconies
* Labels with arrows on the drawing: Roof plan 1; Roof plan 2
* Roof Plan 1:
* Area A: Counts because it is roofed
* Area B: Does not count because this arbor is substantially open
* Area C: Does not count because the overhang is the same size as the overhang around the rest of the house and is considered to be open
* Dimensional labels on plan: Width of overhang over the balcony; Width of overhang around the rest of the house
* Roof Plan 2:
* Area A: Counts because it is roofed
* Area B: Counts because the overhang here is greater than the overhang around the rest of the house, and considered to be roofed
* Area C: Does not count because it is open
* Dimensional labels on plan: Width of overhang over the balcony; Width of overhang around the rest of the house
* Note: Pop-out balconies are subject to the same evaluation.
