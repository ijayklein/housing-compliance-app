* Grade

## Table
* Column headers: When measuring | Use | Which is defined as | Illus.

Row 1
* When measuring: The height of a structure on land with natural slope ≤ 10%
* Use: Existing Grade
* Which is defined as: for each building or structure, the lowest point of adjacent ground elevation prior to grading or fill
* Illus.: **Figure 44** on this page

Row 2
* When measuring: The height of a structure on land with natural slope > 10%
* Use: Grade
* Which is defined as: adjacent ground elevation of the finished or existing grade, whichever is lower—at any point of the structure
* Illus.: **Figure 45** on this page

Row 3
* When measuring: A daylight plane
* Use: Average grade
* Which is defined as: average of the grade at the midpoint of the building and the grade at the closest point on the abutting site
* Illus.: Figs 20–21 pp. 26–27
