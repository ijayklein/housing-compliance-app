The top row shows a flag lot, a standard corner lot, and a substandard corner lot. The bottom row shows a through lot, a wedge-shaped lot, and two lots with more than four sides. Each diagram depicts the lot lines, adjacent streets, sidewalks, required setbacks, and the resulting buildable area (shaded gray). Annotations with arrows point to specific features to explain the rules for determining front, rear, and side yards and setback dimensions.",
