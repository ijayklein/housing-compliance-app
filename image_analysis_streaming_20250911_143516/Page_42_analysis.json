'Pavers without mortar (grass between) OK': Shows a driveway made of irregular stone pavers with grass growing in the gaps.\n2. '\"Hollywood strips\" (grass between) OK': Shows two parallel, paved tire tracks with a strip of grass in the middle.\n3. 'Gravel OK': Shows a gravel driveway with detailed annotations. A curved radius is shown where the driveway meets the property line. Callouts with leader lines point to various features: \n- A note about turns being maneuverable as deemed by the Transportation Division.\n- An '8' min. width for driveway surface (typ. all)' indicated with dimension lines.\n- A '10' min. width for driveway clearance (typ. all)' indicated with dimension lines.\n- A solid black section at the bottom of the gravel driveway, adjacent to the sidewalk, is marked with a '10' min' dimension and a note: 'No gravel or similar loose materials within 10' of the public right-of-way (lot line)'.\n- A note indicating that work in the public Right-Of-Way (ROW) requires a street-work permit.",
