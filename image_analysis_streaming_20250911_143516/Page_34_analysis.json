The diagram shows the house profile with a porch and two dormers on a foundation above ground level. It is annotated with various zoning measurements and lines. A vertical dashed line labeled 'Setback line' and a thick vertical line labeled 'Rear lot line' define the 'Rear yard'. A dashed line, representing the daylight plane, starts at a height of 16' at the setback line and angles upwards and away from the house at 60\u00b0. Other labels indicate '24' max. for protrusions', 'Max. bldg. height', and rules for protrusions from the roof dormers: '7.5' max. each protrusion' with a '5' min. separation'.
