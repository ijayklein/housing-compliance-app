The diagram shows that for each side of the subject structure, the average grade is calculated from two points: one at the midpoint of the subject building's side wall and the other at the closest point on the abutting neighbor's site. These points are indicated by black dots, and lines connect them to callout boxes. The diagram labels 'Front yard', 'Rear yard', 'Interior-side yard', 'Buildable area', and shows a sidewalk and street running along the bottom edge.",
