Diagram A is annotated with dimensional requirements. \n- Diagram A: Shows a bay window supported by brackets. It is labeled 'Does NOT count'. It has two annotations: '2' max. from bay window surface to facade surface (Typical all)' pointing to the horizontal projection, and '18\" min. from top of floor to bottom of baywindow structure' pointing to the vertical clearance above the floor joists.\n- Diagram B: Shows a bay window where the floor joists extend into the bay window structure. It is labeled 'Counts because floor joists continue into the bay window'.\n- Diagram C & D: Shows two variations of a bay window supported by a solid exterior skirt wall, one angled and one straight. It is labeled 'Count because of exterior skirt wall (angled or straight)'.\n- Diagram E: Shows a bay window that is mostly a solid wall with a small window opening. It is labeled 'Counts because the surface is not at least 50% glass'.",
