It illustrates how spaces with at least 5' of head clearance are counted towards gross floor area. The diagram shows a foundation, a 1st floor, a 2nd floor, and an attic space under a pitched roof. A staircase provides access between floors. Two areas are highlighted with hatching: 'Area A' is the central portion of the attic, designated as 3rd floor area. 'Area B' is a perimeter space on the right side of the 2nd floor, situated under the sloped roof. A vertical dimension line on the left side indicates a height of '5'' from the floor to the sloped ceiling. Callout lines point to various parts of the structure, with labels on the right side being partially cut off. The label 'cc' is near the stairs.",
