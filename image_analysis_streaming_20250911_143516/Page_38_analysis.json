The diagram illustrates the 'daylight plane' regulation. A vertical line labeled 'Side lot line' is shown on both sides of the structure. The daylight plane is represented by a dashed line that starts at a height of 8 feet from the average grade at the lot line, extends vertically, and then slopes inwards over the structure at a 1:3 ratio (indicated by a right-angle triangle with sides labeled '1' and '3'). The diagram also indicates a '12' max. height of building' from the average grade.",
