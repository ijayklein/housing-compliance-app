          "description": "A site plan diagram titled 'Fig 40 Examples of site plan w/below-grade patios'. It shows an 'Interior lot example' with a 'Main dwelling' and a '2nd dwelling'. The lot is divided into a 'Front yard', 'Rear yard', and two 'Interior-side yard' areas. Dashed lines indicate 'Required setbacks', defining a 'Buildable area'. Two below-grade patios are shown. One, labeled 'a', is on the side of the main dwelling, encroaching into the side yard with a '2' max. encroachment' and 'landscaping screening'. The other, labeled 'b', is at the rear of the 2nd dwelling, encroaching into the rear yard with a '4' max. encroachment'. A dimension line indicates a '10' min. separation' between the two patios. The patios are represented by different patterns, explained in the key. The length of encroachment for both 'a' and 'b' is indicated with dimension lines.",
