This is a detailed architectural diagram showing the front elevation of two adjacent houses on sloped ground. It illustrates the concept of the daylight plane. Key elements shown include: a dashed line representing the daylight plane originating 10 feet above average grade at the side lot line and extending upwards at a 45-degree angle into the property. Vertical lines indicate the 'Side lot line'. Dimension lines show '24' max. for protrusions' and 'Max. building height'. Labels point to 'Average grade', 'Grade at the nearest point on the adjacent lot', and 'Existing grade of the structure (at midpoint of wall)'. A label near a chimney indicates 'Max. allowed is Min. required by Building Code'. An asterisk is next to the 'Max. building height' label.",
