The diagram shows a house with a gabled roof and a covered porch. Several elements are highlighted with pointers and annotations: 1. A chimney on the side of the upper floor is labeled 'Chimneys on the upper floors DO NOT COUNT'. 2. Two large, ground-based chimneys attached to the house are covered by a single annotation: 'All configurations of fireplaces, chimneys, and buttresses COUNT ONCE towards the gross floor area. Note: Fireplaces not connected to the house are treated like accessory structures, they and count towards FAR if they are greater than 120 sf.
