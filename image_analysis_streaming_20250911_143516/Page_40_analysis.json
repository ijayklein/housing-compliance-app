The top space is labeled 'Required covered space' and shows a car inside a garage-like structure. Its dimensions are marked as '10' min inside clearance' for width and '20' min. inside clearance' for length. The bottom space is labeled '2nd space (uncovered) Tandem OK' and shows a car in an open space. Its dimensions are marked as '8.5' min uncovered space' for width and '18' min. uncovered space' for length. Three asterisks are present on the diagram, one pointing to the 10' width dimension, one to the 20' length dimension, and one to the general area of the uncovered space, likely referencing the bulleted notes.",
