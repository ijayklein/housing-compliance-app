Non-roofed porches, entryways, balconies etc.\n   \u2022 Non-roofed features generally do not count\n\n2. Roofed porches on the 1st floor (Fig 4 A & D on p. 7, Fig 5 on p. 8)\n   \u2022 Openess of the sides determines whether or not these count\n     regardless of the height.\n   \u2022 If they do count, they count only once.\n\n3. Roofed entry features on the 1st floor\n   that are less than 12' high (from grade) (Fig 4 B on p. 7)\n   \u2022 These count once regardless of the design including openess.\n\n4.
