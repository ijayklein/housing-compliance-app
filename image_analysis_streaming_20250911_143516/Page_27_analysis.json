It starts with a box asking 'Does block have more than 3 lots?'. An arrow labeled 'Yes' points to a second box that lists types of lots to exclude (Flag lot, Multi-family, Corner lot) and then asks 'Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?'. Another 'Yes' arrow points to a third box instructing to 'Exclude the smallest and largest setbacks' and then to 'Find the average of the remaining lots... If greater than 30', it applies.'. An arrow from this box points to a final box showing the calculation for the example in Fig 15: (30 (A) + 33 (B) + 35 (F)) / 3 = 32.7. A separate note box to the left of the flowchart specifies rules for blocks longer than 600'.",
