It starts with a box titled 'Exclude the following types of lots', which points to a second box titled 'Divide the remaining lots, including the subject lot, into two categories'. This second box has two outputs: '1. Front-half pattern lots' and '2. Rear-half pattern lots'. These outputs are visually represented by arrows pointing to boxes labeled 'Front half' and 'Rear half' respectively. An arrow from the 'Rear half' box points to a final conclusion box stating that the regulation applies and the garage must be placed in the rear half of the lot.",
