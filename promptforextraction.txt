## Task
Analyze the text (textual extraction of a book page discussing city planning regulations) for the purpose of extracting structured and detailed validation data.

### Analysis Categories
For each file, extract the following using this schema:
- **Qualifiers**: Scope, applicability, exclusions
- **Variables**: Dimensional, material, environmental, usage parameters
- **Constants**: Numerical values, specs, standards, procedures  
- **Conditions**: Mandatory, optional, conditional logic, dependencies
- **Exceptions**: Explicit deviations, alternatives, special cases
- **Relationships**: Hierarchical, cross-references, logical dependencies

### More than one rule/regulation per file
In some cases, the text may contain more than one regulation. In this case, duplicate the process per rule.

### Output Requirements
- Follow the schema exactly
- Preserve hierarchical structures
- Extract precise values with units
- Detect and map all inter-relationships (in case of more than one rule per file)
- Keep in mind that your output will serve an automated validation process
- Flag ambiguous language

### Processing Steps
1. Load and parse the text file
2. Extract all validation components systematically
3. Detect if more than one rule per file
4. Structure outputs according to schema
6. Validate completeness and consistency

### Quality Criteria
- **Completeness**: All rule elements identified
- **Accuracy**: Correct values and units extracted
- **Relationships**: Proper mapping of dependencies
- **Hierarchy**: Original structure preserved
- **Validation**: Output enables compliance checking


Precision and completeness are critical.
