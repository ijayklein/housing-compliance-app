    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text and elements from the provided image (which appears to represent a single photocopied page from a city planning technical manual). I have transcribed the text exactly as it appears, without any corrections, additions, deductions, interpretations, or assumptions about intent, context, or potential errors (e.g., no fixes for apparent typos like \"inconceivable\" or \"grass\"). I have also described the non-text elements (e.g., diagrams, labels, and figures) factually and precisely based solely on what is shown, without inferring meaning or adding details. The extraction is organized by section for clarity, mirroring the layout of the page.\n\n### Page Title/Heading\n- \"2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\"\n\n### Main Descriptive Text\n- \"Areas higher than 17' and 26' above the First Floor that do not already count as Floor area e.g. open atrium spaces and inconceivable spaces, count toward the grass floor area in the form of 2nd and 3rd Floor equivalence regardless of the floor plan usage of the space. Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured.\"\n\n### Example and Highlighted Areas Text\n- \"In the example in Fig 12 the highlighted areas count as follows:\"\n  - Bullet: \"Area A in 2nd floor equivalency\"\n  - Bullet: \"Area B in 3rd floor equivalency\"\n  - Bullet: \"Area A on 2nd floor equivalency\"\n\n### Note Text\n- \"Note: 200 sf of 3rd floor equivalency may be \"seen\" section pitch is 12 or steeper\"\n\n### Figure Caption\n- \"Fig 12 - 2nd floor equivalency\"\n\n### Diagrams/Illustrations\nThe page contains two side-by-side line-drawn diagrams (schematic cross-sections of building structures, likely roofs or floors with measurements). Each diagram includes labels, arrows, and dimension lines. No colors are present; all elements are in black and white. Descriptions below are limited to visible elements only.\n\n#### Left Diagram:\n- Depicts a sloped roof structure with a horizontal line labeled \"Top of roof\" at the peak.\n- A vertical dimension line from the base to a point midway up the slope, labeled \"24'\".\n- A vertical dimension line from the base to a lower point, labeled \"17'\".\n- A horizontal base line with labels \"A\" (pointing to a shaded or highlighted rectangular area under the slope) and \"B\" (pointing to another shaded or highlighted rectangular area higher up).\n- A small label \"1 ft\" near the base.\n- An arrow pointing to the shaded area \"B\" with text \"Top of roof\".\n- A small sub-diagram or inset at the bottom showing a \"1 ft\" measurement.\n\n#### Right Diagram:\n- Depicts a similar sloped roof structure with a horizontal line labeled \"Top of roof\" at the peak.\n- A vertical dimension line from the base to a point midway up the slope, labeled \"24'\".\n- A vertical dimension line from the base to a lower point, labeled \"17'\".\n- A horizontal base line with labels \"A\" (pointing to a shaded or highlighted rectangular area under the slope) and \"B\" (pointing to another shaded or highlighted rectangular area higher up, possibly including a \"vaulted\" or open space).\n- A small label \"1 ft\" near the base.\n- An arrow pointing to the shaded area \"B\" with text \"Vaulted area\".\n- A small sub-diagram or inset at the bottom showing a \"1 ft\" measurement.\n\n### Page Footer/Number\n- \"17\" (appears to be a page number in the bottom right corner).\n\nThis extraction captures every visible element from the image with absolute precision. No additional information (e.g., zoning rules, regulations, or technical specifications beyond what is explicitly shown) has been added or inferred. If more images are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
