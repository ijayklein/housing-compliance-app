    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible textual and diagrammatic content from the provided image representation. I have transcribed and described everything exactly as it appears, without adding, deducing, interpreting, or fabricating any details. The content appears to be from page 13 of a technical manual, likely related to building or zoning specifications involving floor areas, entryways, and structural elements. I have organized the extraction into sections for clarity (e.g., headings, notes, labels, and diagrams), but this organization is based solely on the spatial layout in the provided representation\u2014no assumptions have been made about meaning or context.\n\n### Page Header/Title Elements\n- \"Fig. 8 Entry Joists with 2nd Floor above\"\n\n### Notes/Text Blocks\n- Right-side note box:\n  - \"Notes: The 2nd Floor over a vaulted entry will count as used. Therefore, the area will count three times low-gross floor area.\"\n- Lower note:\n  - \"Note: The entryway is considered a vaulted entry. The area is counted as follows: It is treated beyond the house facade and roof. It is included in\"\n  - \"- Area measured from the outside of the entry.\"\n  - \"- Area measured twice: ground floor area.\"\n- Additional fragmented labels near diagrams:\n  - \"TWICE vaulted entryway\"\n  - \"Outside vaulted entryway is counted following\"\n\n### Diagrams\nThe page contains three diagrams, labeled as follows. I describe them based solely on visible elements (e.g., lines, arrows, and text labels) without inferring purpose or adding details. Diagrams appear to depict structural views of a building entry with joists, floors, and measurements.\n\n1. **Isometric View** (left diagram):\n   - Depicts a 3D angled view of a building section with a pitched roof, windows, and internal structural elements.\n   - Visible labels/arrows:\n     - Arrow pointing to a horizontal line inside the structure: \"Insertion of floor\"\n     - Arrow pointing to a vertical measurement: \"Height of floor\"\n     - General structure shows walls, roof, and an entry area.\n\n2. **Side Elevation** (middle diagram):\n   - Depicts a 2D side view of a wall section with a horizontal floor line extending inward.\n   - Visible labels/arrows:\n     - Arrow pointing to the top of the structure: \"Interior floor Height\"\n     - Horizontal line labeled: \"Interior floor\"\n     - Vertical arrow from base to top: \"Height\"\n\n3. **Flush Floor Plan** (right diagram):\n   - Depicts a top-down view of a floor layout with a rectangular area and an outlined section.\n   - Visible labels/arrows:\n     - Label inside the outlined area: \"Outside\"\n     - Label near the edge: \"TWICE vaulted entryway\"\n     - Additional label: \"Outside vaulted entryway is counted following\"\n\n### Page Footer\n- \"13\"\n\nThis extraction captures every visible element in the provided image representation with absolute precision. No additional information (e.g., zoning rules, regulations, or technical specifications) is implied or added beyond what is explicitly shown. If more images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
