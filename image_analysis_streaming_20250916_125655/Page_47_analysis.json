    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text and discernible details from the provided image representations of the photocopied pages. I have transcribed only what is explicitly present in the text and diagrams, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, corrections (e.g., for apparent typos like \"audience\" instead of a possible intended word), or assumptions. Information is organized by section for clarity, based solely on the structure in the images. Diagrams are described only in terms of their visible labels and captions, without inferring meaning or content.\n\n### Page Header/Title\n- Other excavation considerations\n\n### Subsection: Architectural compatibility & landscape screening\n- A guard rail designed to be architecturally compatible with the audience is likely to be required by the Planning Board. Landscape screening may be required by the Planning Board.\n- (Note: The text appears fragmented or partially obscured in the image, with \"technically compatible with the audience\" repeating or overlapping the prior line.)\n\n### Tree Protection Notes\n- Tree protection notes will be the drip line and\n- Roots are to be within the top 18\" below grade.\n- It is important to plan excavation in a manner that does not\n- Prior issue of building permit, owner can provide evidence of any species on site or adjacent to abut lot but not tree protection during construction. Manual about impact of tree protection during construction.\n\n### Figure 37: Excavation, landscape screening, and guard rails\n- (Diagram depicts a cross-section of an excavation site with a guard rail along a sloped edge. Visible labels in the diagram:)\n  - Guard rail\n  - (Additional note at bottom of diagram:) Guard rail along a steep slope, required for safety of adjacent to excavation. Will be required if slope is steeper than 1:2, or if drop is more than 30\".\n\n### Figure 38: Excavation and tree roots\n- (Diagram depicts a tree with roots extending into an excavation area, showing soil layers and a vertical cut. Visible labels in the diagram:)\n  - Tree\n  - Root\n  - (Additional note at bottom of diagram:) Avoid cutting any significant roots. For any tree with a trunk diameter of 6\" or more, measured 4.5' above ground, a tree protection plan may be required.\n\n### Page Footer\n- 43 (page number)\n\nNo additional zoning rules, regulations, or technical specifications are visible beyond what is transcribed above. The images appear to be from a technical manual section focused on excavation, with an emphasis on safety features like guard rails, landscape screening, and tree root protection during construction. If more images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
