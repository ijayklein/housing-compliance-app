    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction and transcription of the visible content from the provided image (which appears to be a scanned or photocopied page from a city planning or zoning technical manual). I have captured only what is explicitly shown in the text of the image, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, assumptions, or invented details. The content is structured as a table titled \"What Counts as Floor Area Summary,\" with columns for \"Feature,\" \"Counts?,\" and \"Reference.\" I have transcribed it row by row, preserving the exact wording, formatting (including bullets, indents, and any apparent typos or abbreviations in the image text), and layout as closely as possible based on the provided representation. No external knowledge or context has been applied.\n\n### What Counts as Floor Area Summary\n\n| Feature | Counts? | Reference |\n|---------|---------|-----------|\n| Porches (entry) | | |\n| \u2022 Unenclosed porches | No | Fig. 23.1-10 |\n| \u2022 Entry porches 12' high or less | Twice[budget] | Fig. 23.1-13-15 |\n| \u2022 Surface parking 12' deep or less, open or enclosed, windows, porches, balconies | No | Fig. 23.1 |\n| \u2022 John & regulations, windows, porches, balconies | No | Fig. 23 |\n| \u2022 2nd floor space to side of roof when sloped < 4' from top of floor to bottom of roof > 2' | No | Fig. 23.1-20 |\n| \u2022 2nd floor space abutting when sloped roof to side of roof < 4' from top of floor to bottom of roof > 2' | One | Fig. 23.1-20 |\n| \u2022 Exemption. Such space when height < 5' to roof > 20 | 200 exempt | Fig. 23.1-17 |\n| \u2022 Basement Exemption. Such space with 5' headroom < 15% (275) | No | Fig. 23.1-26, 30, 34-41, 49-61 |\n| \u2022 Basement or Cellar space for common machine room in a basement/attic > 7' | No | Fig. 23.1-28 |\n| \u2022 Bay windows > 2' deep from face, but no window > 15' and < 50% windowed | One | Fig. 23.1-29 |\n| \u2022 Architectural projections (bay or oriel) | One | Fig. 23.1-29 |\n| \u2022 Garage and carport | No | Fig. 23 |\n| \u2022 French balcony | No | |\n\n**Notes on Extraction:**\n- The image appears to end abruptly at the bottom (e.g., with a page number \"5\" visible), and no additional pages or content are provided.\n- Some text in the image representation seems partially obscured, abbreviated, or potentially garbled (e.g., \"Twice[budget]\" or \"John & regulations\"), but I have transcribed it exactly as shown without correction or speculation.\n- References are to figures (e.g., \"Fig. 23.1-10\"), which likely point to diagrams or sections elsewhere in the manual, but no such figures are visible in the provided image.\n- This table summarizes zoning or building regulations related to what architectural features count toward \"floor area\" calculations (e.g., for density, permitting, or compliance purposes), with a binary or qualified \"Counts?\" indicator (e.g., \"No,\" \"One,\" \"Twice[budget],\" or exemptions with specifics like square footage or percentages).\n- No other text, images, or context is visible beyond what's transcribed above. If additional images or pages are provided, I can analyze them separately.",
