    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of the visible text and structural elements from the provided image representation. I have transcribed it verbatim, preserving the original wording, formatting, layout, and any apparent abbreviations or notations as they appear (e.g., tables, headers, bullet points, and footnotes). I have not added, inferred, or deduced any information not explicitly present in the image text. Where the text appears fragmented or partially obscured (as is common in photocopies), I have noted it as such without filling in gaps.\n\n### Page Header/Title\nSetbacks\n\n### Left Column\n**Standard setbacks**  \nStandard setbacks apply in most cases.\n\n**Standard setbacks by zone**  \n\n| Zone | Front | Rear | Interior | Street* |  \n|------|-------|------|----------|---------|  \n| R-1 | 20' | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| R-1X | Continued | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| R-1X(5000) | 20' | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| R-2 | 20' | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| R-3 | 20' | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| R-4 | 20' | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| R-5(5000) | 20' | 20' | 5' | 10' |  \n| Unincorporated | 20' | 20' | none | 10' |  \n| Other Lab | 20' | 20' | 10' | 10' |  \n\n* For side yard - abutting street setback applies.  \n* For a lot with a side yard setback of greater than 20'.  \n* For a lot with side yard setback apply the greater of the two.  \n\n**Code sections**  \nPage 3.4.01 Table 2  \nPage 3.4.01 Table 3  \n\nThese required yards  \nmust be maintained  \nto provide for landscaping  \nopportunities to landscape  \nneighborhood attractive  \nvacation of privacy.  \n\n**Page numbers/footers (bottom of page)**  \n20  \n21  \n\n### Right Column\n**Special setbacks**  \nSpecial setbacks override standard  \nsetbacks unless a larger contextual  \nsetback applies.\n\n**Streets / special setbacks**  \n\n| Street | Minimum | Maximum |  \n|--------|---------|---------|  \n| Alameda Ave | Garden St | Mission Ave |  \n| California Ave | 30' | Cabrillo Ave |  \n| Charming Ave | South Ave | Page Blvd |  \n| Chula Vista | Lookout |  \n| East Main St | Mission Ave | West Mission Dr |  \n| El Camino Real | Ave Maria | West Mission Dr |  \n\nSpecial distance can be found on:  \n- page of the city.
