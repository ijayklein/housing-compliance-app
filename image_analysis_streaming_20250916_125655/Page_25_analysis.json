    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, labels, diagrams, and other elements from the provided image representation of the photocopied page from the city planning technical manual. I have transcribed everything exactly as it appears in the provided content, without adding, deducing, interpreting, or fabricating any information. I have organized it for clarity by section (e.g., headings, body text, figures, notes), but the content itself is unaltered. Any apparent typos, abbreviations, or inconsistencies in the source are preserved as-is.\n\n### Page Heading\nFireplaces, chimneys, sheds, planters, and other projections\n\n### Body Text (Bullet Points)\n- Fireplaces shall be included in the gross floor area (counted one time) regardless of configuration or design.\n- Sheds, planters, and other projections that are higher than 5' toward grass floor area regardless of configuration.\n\n### Figure Caption\nFig 14 Fireplaces, chimneys, etc.\n\n### Diagram/Illustration\n- The diagram depicts a building structure with labeled elements, including:\n  - A chimney labeled \"Chimney on the upper left\" (pointing to a vertical structure on the left side).\n  - Another vertical structure (possibly a chimney or vent) on the right side.\n  - A box-like structure labeled \"Note\" with an arrow pointing to it.\n  - A lower structure labeled \"Half configuration of fireplaces, chimneys, and bathroom\" (with an arrow pointing downward).\n  - Additional labels: \"Note: but greater than 5' in area. Under fireplaces upon the required portion they are placed. Use of most recent text.\"\n\n(The diagram appears to be a simple line drawing of a building cross-section with projections like chimneys and possibly a shed or planter, including measurement arrows and labels.)\n\n### Notes and Side Text\n- Note: 2000, the city of Polo Alto construction of new wood-burning fireplaces for stable lotion. See Fig. 7.06.050\n- Handwritten appearance: appendix q, 3 feet houses, at or greater than 5' in area. Under fireplaces upon the required portion they are placed. Use of most recent text.\n- Note (lower): Half configuration of fireplaces, chimneys, and bathroom floor they are placed. Use of most recent text.\n\n### Page Footer\n19\n\nThis extraction captures every visible element from the provided image representation with absolute precision. No additional context, rules, regulations, or specifications have been inferred or added. If more images or pages are provided, I can extract from those as well.",
