    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible and legible textual and diagrammatic content from the provided image of the photocopied page from the city planning technical manual. I have captured only what is explicitly present in the image, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or invented details. The content appears to be illustrative diagrams of architectural features (porches and entry ways) with captions, rather than explicit zoning rules, regulations, or technical specifications (though the diagrams may relate to such topics based on the context). I have organized the extraction for clarity, mirroring the layout and structure as closely as possible.\n\n### Page Title/Figure Label\n- Fig. 4 Types of porches and entry ways.\n\n### Diagrams and Captions\nThe page contains four labeled diagrams of residential structures, each depicting a different type of porch or entry way. The diagrams are line drawings with some measurement annotations (e.g., height labels). They are arranged in two rows:\n\n#### Top Row:\n- **Diagram A**: Illustration of a house with a covered front porch extending from the main structure. The porch has a roof and columns. A vertical measurement line is shown from the ground to the roof edge, labeled \"Height of porch.\"\n  - Caption below: A Roofed porch\n\n- **Diagram C**: Illustration of a house with an arched or vaulted entry way at the front door. A vertical measurement line is shown from the ground to the top of the vaulted area, labeled \"Height of entry.\"\n  - Caption below: C Vaulted entry way.\n\n#### Central Note (between top and bottom rows):\n- See how to measure height of porches & entry ways in Figs 4-6 on pp. 11-13\n\n#### Bottom Row:\n- **Diagram B**: Illustration of a house with a small covered entry way at the front door. The entry way has a roof but appears narrower and not fully enclosed like a porch. A vertical measurement line is shown from the ground to the roof edge, labeled \"Height of entry.\" An additional label points to the roof area: \"Roofed entry way not roofed\" (note: this phrasing appears as-is in the image and may contain a typographical inconsistency).\n  - Caption below: B Roofed entry way not roofed\n\n- **Diagram D**: Illustration of a house combining a porch and a vaulted entry way. The porch is roofed, and there is an arched vault above the door. Vertical measurement lines are shown, with labels such as \"Height of porch\" and \"Height of entry.\"\n  - Caption below: D Combination porch & vaulted entry way.\n\n### Additional Observations\n- No other text, rules, regulations, or technical specifications are visible in the image.\n- The diagrams include basic architectural line art of houses (e.g., gabled roofs, windows, doors) but no numerical measurements, scales, or detailed specs beyond the height labels mentioned above.\n- The page appears to be from a technical manual section on measurements, as referenced in the central note, but no further details from pp. 11-13 or Figs 4-6 are present in this image.\n\nIf additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
