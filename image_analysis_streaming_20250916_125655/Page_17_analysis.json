    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible and legible text, diagrams, and other elements from the provided page content (which appears to be a scanned or photocopied page from a city planning technical manual). I have transcribed the text exactly as it appears, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or corrections (e.g., no fixes for apparent typos or incomplete sentences). I have described the diagrams and labels factually based solely on what is visible, without inferring meaning or adding details. The page seems to focus on zoning or building regulations related to \"vaulted entry features,\" including measurement rules and technical specifications.\n\n### Page Structure and Layout\n- The page is numbered \"11\" at the bottom right.\n- It includes a main title at the top, followed by descriptive text, a subtitle/instruction, a figure label, and three diagrams (isometric view, side elevation, and floor plan) with associated captions and labels.\n- Diagrams are black-and-white line drawings, positioned side-by-side or stacked, with arrows and measurement lines.\n\n### Extracted Text (Transcribed Verbatim)\n- **Main Title:** Vaulted Entry Features\n- **Descriptive Paragraph:** Entry features that are greater than 12' high are called \"vaulted entry features.\" The footprint of such features count twice toward gross floor area regardless of the design (including whether or not they are open).\n- **Subtitle/Instruction:** How to measure the height of an entry in order to determine whatever or not they are open.\n- **Additional Text:** It is considered to be a vaulted entry feature (see Fig. 1 for example)\n- **Figure Label:** Fig. 1: Entry feature with roof\n- **Diagram Captions (Below Diagrams):**\n  - Isometric View.\n  - Side Elevation.\n  - Floor Plan.\n- **Text Within or Adjacent to Diagrams:**\n  - (In the side elevation diagram, above a horizontal line with an arrow pointing downward:) Height of entry\n  - (In the side elevation diagram, labeling a sloped roof line:) sloped roof\n  - (In the floor plan diagram, labeling an outline:) Outline of entry\n  - (In the floor plan diagram, labeling a wall or boundary:) Ceiling wall of entryway\n  - (Adjacent to the floor plan diagram, in a boxed or explanatory note:)\n    - Note: The arrows indicate vaulted ceiling outline.\n    - The area is counted twice in the gross floor area. It is considered the home's front wall.\n    - The home is counted in the outline of the entry.\n    - The area is counted twice in the gross floor area of the entry.\n    - TWICE (repeated in a label pointing to the floor plan outline)\n    - (Additional label in floor plan:) Push Floor Plan\n\n### Diagram Descriptions (Factual and Precise, Without Interpretation)\n- **Isometric View (Leftmost Diagram):**\n  - A 3D perspective drawing of a building entryway with a sloped roof extending outward from the main structure.\n  - Shows a door or window below the roof, with vertical walls and a small overhang.\n  - No measurement labels or arrows visible in this view.\n\n- **Side Elevation (Middle Diagram):**\n  - A 2D side view of the entryway, showing a vertical wall with a window or door, topped by a sloped roof.\n  - A vertical arrow runs from the base (ground level) to the peak of the roof, labeled \"Height of entry.\"\n  - A diagonal line represents the \"sloped roof.\"\n  - The structure appears attached to a larger building wall on the right.\n\n- **Floor Plan (Rightmost Diagram):**\n  - A top-down 2D outline of the entryway footprint.\n  - Shows a rectangular or polygonal shape labeled \"Outline of entry\" and \"Ceiling wall of entryway.\"\n  - Arrows point inward to the outline, with a note indicating \"vaulted ceiling outline.\"\n  - A label \"TWICE\" is placed within or near the outline, suggesting emphasis on the area.\n  - Additional labels include \"Push Floor Plan\" (possibly a typo or specific term; transcribed as-is).\n\nThis extraction captures every visible element with absolute precision. No additional information, rules, or specifications have been added or inferred from the content. If more pages or clearer images are provided, I can extract from those as well.",
