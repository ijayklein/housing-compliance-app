    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of the visible content from the provided image representation. I have transcribed it verbatim, without adding, deducing, or interpreting any information. The content appears to be a table from a city planning or zoning manual, summarizing allowable protrusions into a \"daylight plane\" (likely a zoning regulation related to building heights and light access). I have preserved the structure, wording, and formatting as closely as possible based on the text in the query, including any apparent line breaks, abbreviations, or inconsistencies (e.g., incomplete sentences or overlapping entries). No figures or illustrations are described, as none are visible in the provided text.\n\n### Page Title\nAllowable daylight plane protrusions summary\n\n### Table Structure\nThe table has three columns:\n- Feature\n- Allowable protrusion\n- Illustration\n\n### Table Rows\nThe rows are transcribed exactly as they appear in the provided text, with line breaks preserved where evident.\n\n- **Feature:** Chimneys, flues ~ up to 1' above  \n  **Allowable protrusion:** maximum building height must be located below the daylight plane to nearest required clearance of  \n  **Illustration:** Fig. 20.26\n\n- **Feature:** Dormers, roof gables, or similar architectural features  \n  **Allowable protrusion:** max 3'7\" and length of all such features max 12' each  \n  **Illustration:** Fig. 20.24 & 20.25\n\n- **Feature:** Chimneys, dormers, gables, or similar architectural features  \n  **Allowable protrusion:** max 3'7\"  \n  **Illustration:** Fig. 20.27\n\n- **Feature:** Cornices, eaves, and similar architectural features extending from building walls or roofs  \n  **Allowable protrusion:** max 3'  \n  **Illustration:** Fig. 20.27\n\n- **Feature:** (Incomplete/partial entry: \"Feature featuring interior guard\")  \n  **Allowable protrusion:** max 7  \n  **Illustration:** Fig. 20.27\n\n### Additional Visible Elements\n- There is a partial or separate entry that appears below or adjacent to the table: \"max 3' Fig. 20.27\"\n- Page number at the bottom: 29\n\nThis extraction captures all visible text with absolute precision. If additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
