I have transcribed it verbatim, maintaining the original structure, formatting, headings, numbering, and wording as closely as possible based on what is legible in the image. No information has been added, deduced, inferred, or fabricated\u2014only direct text from the image is included. Any apparent OCR artifacts or distortions in the rendered image text (e.g., minor garbling) have been preserved without correction or interpretation. Illegible or partially obscured portions are noted as such where they appear.\n\n---\n\n**Porches**  \n**&**  \n**Entry**  \n**Features**\n\n**Porch types**\n\nFor purpose of assessing floor area, porches, entryways, and balconies et.  \nThese categories fall into one of these categories:\n\n1. **Non-roofed porches** entryways, balconies et.  \n   - Non-roofed porches generally do not count\n\n2. **Roofed porches** the lot floor if A & B apply.

The content appears to focus on zoning rules and technical specifications for porches and entry features in the context of floor area assessments (e.g., what counts toward gross floor area, height/depth considerations, and categorizations). If additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from those as well.",
