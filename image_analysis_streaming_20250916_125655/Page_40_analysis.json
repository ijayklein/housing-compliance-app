I have transcribed only what is explicitly present in the text-based \"image\" you shared, without any additions, corrections, deductions, interpretations, or assumptions about garbled or unclear portions (e.g., no attempts to \"fix\" apparent typos, incomplete words, or OCR-like errors). I have organized it to reflect the apparent layout: left column, right column, figure/diagram, and any other elements. No zoning rules, regulations, or technical specifications have been inferred or invented\u2014only direct transcription is included.\n\n### Left Column (Text Block)\nParking  \nParking regulations of  \nlead regulation of  \nresidential neighboring-  \nhoods by minimizing  \nthe number of cars  \nand in the front yards  \nby requiring that there  \nare parking spaces  \nbehind the house who  \nhu lot  \n\nCode section:  \nR-1200, 18-120, 03D  \nR-1500, 18-110.04  \nClear something.  \n\nhu  \n\n### Right Column (Text Block)\nParking space standards  \n\nFig. 32 Parking space dimensions for garage  \nand dimensions  \n\n- Two spaces are required on the lot per  \nThey may NOT be located in the  \nrequired front yard (see 18-4.d).  \n- 2nd-dwelling garage spaces required  \nby variance.  \n- One of the two spaces must be covered.  \nParking structure must be a minimum of  \n20' from the street.  \n- Minimum size for an uncovered is  \n9' wide by 18' deep.
