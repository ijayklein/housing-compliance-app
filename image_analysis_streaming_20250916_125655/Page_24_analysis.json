    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, labels, and structural elements from the provided image (which appears to be a photocopied page from a city planning or building technical manual, focused on zoning or design regulations for bay windows). I have transcribed everything verbatim, maintaining the original wording, formatting, and layout as closely as possible based on the image's content. No information has been added, inferred, deduced, or invented\u2014only what is explicitly present in the image is included. I've organized it into sections for clarity (e.g., headings, body text, notes, figure labels), but these organizational labels are not part of the original image.\n\n### Page Header/Title\nProjections  \nBay windows  \n\n### Main Descriptive Text\nBay windows that meet the design criteria below are considered to be decorative  \narchitectural features and do NOT count toward gross floor area.  \n\nDesign criteria for bay windows that do not count:  \n- Portion of facade no more than 15' above the floor plate  \n- Bay window cold-formed  \n\nNote: Bay windows that extend to the roof are considered to be a floor area  \naddition. They do not meet design criteria and do count toward gross floor area.  \n\n### Sidebar Text (Left Side)\nArchitectural relief  \nwindows on bay  \nadditions to a house  \ndesign and are  \nmost often design  \ncriteria they do not  \ncount toward gross  \nfloor area.  \n\n### Figure Label\nFig. 13 Bay windows  \n\n### Diagrams and Labels (From Left to Right)\n- Diagram A:  \n  A  \n  Does NOT count  \n  - Bay window from floor  \n\n- Diagram B:  \n  B  \n  Counts  \n  - Bay window from wall  \n\n- Diagrams C & D:  \n  C & D  \n  Counts  \n  - Angled or straight wall  \n\n- Diagram E:  \n  E  \n  Counts  \n  - Various to floor  \n\n- Diagram F:  \n  F  \n  Counts  \n  - Various to floor  \n\n### Page Footer\n14  \nSection 3  \n\n### Additional Observations on Image Elements\n- The image includes five simple line-drawing diagrams of bay window configurations (labeled A through F, with C and D combined), each showing a side view of a building structure with measurements or arrows indicating projections from walls or floors. No specific numerical measurements (beyond the \"15'\" in the text) are legible in the diagrams themselves.\n- There are faint lines, arrows, and shading in the diagrams, but no additional text or labels beyond what's transcribed above.\n- The overall page appears to be from a technical manual section on architectural projections, with a focus on how bay windows impact gross floor area calculations in zoning or building regulations.\n\nIf you provide additional images or pages, I can extract from those as well.",
