    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text and structural elements from the provided image of the photocopied page(s) from the city planning technical manual. I have transcribed the content verbatim, maintaining the original formatting, layout, and phrasing as closely as possible (including any apparent abbreviations, incomplete sentences, or figure references). I have not added, deduced, or interpreted any information that is not explicitly present in the image. Incomplete or partially visible text is noted as such where it appears truncated or unclear. No assumptions have been made about missing context, diagrams, or implications.\n\n### Page Layout Overview\n- The page is divided into two main columns/sections: Left side focused on \"Basements\" and right side on \"Excavated Features.\"\n- There are headings, bullet points, subheadings (e.g., \"FAR\"), figure references (Fig. 38 and Fig. 39), and diagram labels (e.g., A, B).\n- Diagrams are referenced but not fully describable as images; only their captions and labels are extracted.\n\n### Extracted Text (Left Column: Basements)\n**Basements & Excavated Features**\n\n**Basement standards**\n- May not be located in special flood hazard areas.\n- May not extend into required yards, except where main dwelling is permitted into rear yard.\n\n**FAR**  \nBasements (even habitable areas) do  \nnot count as floor area if first floor  \nis more than 3' above grade.\n\nFig. 38 Basement & grade.\n\n*(Below the figure reference, there is additional text that appears related to floor area regulations:)*  \nFloor area regulations  \nare intended to address  \nthe building mass and  \nthe apparent area of  \nbelow grade and does  \nif apparent area is  \nbelow grade and does  \napparent mass of a  \nbuilding that area.  \nnot add to the  \nthe total floor area.\n\n*(This section appears partially truncated or faded in the image. Continuing below:)*  \n\n**Code section**  \nA.1  \n\n*(A small diagram or icon is referenced here, but no further details are visible.)*\n\n*(Page number or footer:)*  \n42  \n\n### Extracted Text (Right Column: Excavated Features)\n**Excavated Features**\n- There are two types of excavated features\n- Below grade patios\n- Below grade parking\n\n**FAR**  \nExcavation will not affect grade or  \nmeasurement of floor area per 42 and 43[?].  \n*(The number after \"43\" is unclear or truncated in the image.)*\n\nFig. 39 Excavated features & grade.\n\n*(Below the figure reference, there is a diagram with labeled elements:)*\n- **A** Between 30' to 40' of lot line  \n- **B** Distance between top of wall  \n  and grade line, max. 4'-0\"  \n- **C** Distance between top of wall  \n  and grade line, max. 4'-0\"  \n\n*(Additional diagram labels below:)*  \nFig. 39 (a) 30'-0\" to 40'-0\"  \nExcavated horizon.  \nFig. 39 (b) 30'-0\" to 40'-0\".  \n\n*(Page number or footer:)*  \n43  \n\nThis extraction captures all visible textual content related to zoning rules, regulations, and technical specifications (e.g., standards for basements, FAR calculations, excavation types, measurements, and code references). If additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from those as well.",
