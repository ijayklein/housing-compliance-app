    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, labels, diagrams, and other elements from the provided image. I have transcribed everything verbatim and organized it for clarity based on the structure and layout apparent in the image description. I have not added, deduced, or interpreted any information beyond what is explicitly present\u2014no assumptions about context, implications, or missing details have been made. The extraction is divided into sections matching the image's apparent organization (e.g., headings, lists, diagrams, notes).\n\n### Main Heading\nStep 4a. Finalize determination of which segments are closed and which are open. Total the linear feet in each category, and compare to the totals.\n\n### Text Below Heading\nFor the porch in Fig. A, it is as follows.\n\n### Segmented Lists\n- **Closed**  \n  Segment Front  \n  7'  \n  8'  \n  14'  \n  35'\n\n- **Open**  \n  Segment Front  \n  7'  \n  8'  \n  24'  \n  35'\n\n### Diagram (Upper Right)\n- A schematic illustration of a porch structure, viewed from the side or in cross-section.  \n  - Labels and elements include:  \n    - \"Closed segment\" (pointing to a solid or enclosed portion).  \n    - \"Open\" (pointing to an open or unenclosed portion).  \n    - Measurement: \"24\" ground floor area\" (appearing near the base or floor level).  \n    - Structural elements: A sloped roof or overhang, vertical supports, and a base labeled with \"P\" and \"D\" (possibly denoting points or dimensions).  \n    - Additional lines and arrows indicating segments or measurements.\n\n### Conclusion Section\nConclusion: The perimeter of the porch in Fig. A is 50% open and so the porch WOULD NOT count toward gross floor area.\n\n### Sidebar Note (Gray Box, Left Side)\nNote: If a porch floor is more than 36\" above grade, the side panels may need to be 36\" high for safety reasons. This may cause the porch facade segments right instead of half solid walls. Porch railings not above, solid half walls.\n\n- An arrow points from this note to a small diagram below it.\n\n### Additional Diagrams (Lower Section)\n- Three small schematic illustrations of porch structures, viewed from the side or in cross-section.  \n  - Left diagram: Labeled \"Closed\" at the top, showing an enclosed structure with a back wall and floor.  \n  - Middle diagram: Unlabeled, showing a partially open structure with a railing or half-wall.  \n  - Right diagram: Labeled \"Open\" at the top, showing an open structure with no enclosure.  \n  - Shared labels across diagrams:  \n    - \"Back wall\" (on the left diagram).  \n    - \"Grade\" (at the base of all diagrams).  \n    - \"Open\" (at the bottom of the middle and right diagrams).\n\n### Page Number (Bottom)\n10\n\nThis completes the extraction. No other text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible in the provided image description. If additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
