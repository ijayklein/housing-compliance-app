    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, labels, and diagram elements from the provided image. I have transcribed everything exactly as it appears, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or invented details. The image appears to be a page from a technical manual (page 12, based on the footer), featuring a figure with diagrams and accompanying notes. I have organized the extraction by section for clarity, but the content is reproduced verbatim.\n\n### Figure Title\nFig. 7 Entry fixture with gabled roof\n\n### Diagrams\nThe image contains three labeled diagrams:\n- **Isometric View** (left side): A 3D illustration of a structure with a gabled roof, showing a wall, window, and roof intersection. Visible labels:\n  - Arrow pointing to the base: \"Intersection of floor and wall (not labeled)\"\n  - Vertical arrow along the wall: \"Height\"\n- **Side Elevation** (middle): A 2D side view of a structure with a collar-like element at the top. Visible labels:\n  - Arrow pointing to a circular element: \"Collar of entry\"\n  - Arrow pointing to an internal feature: \"Twice of entry in ceiling (not labeled)\"\n- **Roof Plan** (right side): A top-down view of a rectangular structure with a central circular element labeled \"Collar of entry\". No additional labels visible.\n\n### Accompanying Note\nNote: If the pathway is continued to a sealed entryway the area will contain the following attributes: located in the home facade and is included in the area, one area outside the sealed green area, the area count, twice the gross floor area.\n\n### Page Footer\n12\n\nNo other text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible in the image. The diagrams appear technical in nature (potentially related to architectural or zoning details for entry fixtures), but I have not inferred or expanded on their meaning. If additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from those as well.",
