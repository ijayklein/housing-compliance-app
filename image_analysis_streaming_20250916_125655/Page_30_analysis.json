    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of the visible text and structural elements from the provided image representation. I have transcribed it verbatim, preserving the original wording, formatting, and layout as closely as possible based on the given text (which appears to be a scanned or OCR-derived representation of a page from a city planning technical manual). I have not added, deduced, or interpreted any information beyond what is explicitly present. Where the text is fragmented, garbled, or incomplete (likely due to image quality or scanning artifacts), I have noted it as such without filling in gaps. The content focuses on zoning rules related to allowable setback encroachments, organized into tables and summaries.\n\n### Page Header\n- **Allowable setback encroachments summary**\n- **Allowable rear encroachment yard**\n\n### Main Table: Allowable Setback Encroachments Summary\nThe table is divided into columns:  \n- **Feature** (describes the structure or element)  \n- **Allowable encroachment** (specifies the allowed intrusion into yards)  \n- **Code Section**  \n- **Button** (this appears to be a possible OCR error or label; it may refer to \"Buttress\" or a figure/button, but is transcribed as-is)  \n\nRows are grouped by feature type.\n\n#### Heating (or similar; text is partially garbled)\n- **Feature**: \n  - Eave, cornice or architectural projection\n  - Unenclosed portion of an exterior stairway\n  - Unenclosed portion of an exterior balcony\n  - Attached garage 5 ft. in height\n  - Detached garage 5 ft. in height\n  - Bay window\n  - Chimney\n  - Fireplace and flue enclosure\n  - Porch and balcony\n  - Ramp for disabled access\n  - Solar energy system\n  - Greenhouse window only\n  - Spa, hot tub equipment\n  - Rain garden\n- **Allowable encroachment**:\n  - To 1 ft. of rear lot line\n  - To 3 ft. of interior side\n  - To 3 ft. of interior side\n  - 18 inches into rear yard 5 ft. max height\n  - In rear yard\n  - In rear or side yards\n  - 7 ft. into the yards\n  - 2 ft. into any yard\n  - 2 ft. into any yard\n  - 7 ft. into the yards\n  - No limit\n  - 2 ft. into any yard\n  - In rear yard only for\n  - 2 ft. max. width\n  - Z side yard only\n  - Z side yard with 2 ft. max pool\n- **Code Section**:\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n- **Button** (or similar label; possibly \"Fig.\" or figure reference):\n  - Fig. A-10\n  - Fig. A-20\n  - Fig. A-20\n  - Fig. A-30\n  - Fig. A-30\n  - Fig. A-40\n  - Fig. A-50\n  - Fig. A-60\n  - Fig. A-70\n  - Fig. A-80\n  - Fig. A-90\n  - Fig. A-100\n  - Fig. A-110\n  - Fig. A-120\n\n#### Detailed Attached garage 5 ft. in height (sub-table or continuation; text is fragmented)\n- **Feature**:\n  - Attached garage 5 ft. in height\n  - Bay window\n  - FYI and 3 ft. street side yard line\n- **Allowable encroachment**:\n  - In rear yard\n  - In rear or side yards\n- **Code Section**:\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n- **Button**:\n  - Fig. A-30\n  - Fig. A-39\n\n#### Porches and features (sub-table or continuation)\n- **Feature**:\n  - Porches and balconies\n  - Stairs, stoops, and fire escapes\n  - Eaves, cornices, architectural projections\n  - Canopies over windows & doors\n  - Composition of window surface &\n  - Greenhouse window only\n  - Spa, pool equipment\n  - Rain garden\n- **Allowable encroachment**:\n  - 7 ft. into the yards\n  - 7 ft. into the yards\n  - 2 ft. into any yard\n  - 2 ft. into any yard\n  - 7 ft. max. width\n  - In rear yard only\n  - In rear yard only\n  - Z side yard with 2 ft. max pool\n- **Code Section**:\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n  - 18.12.040(E)\n- **Button**:\n  - Fig. A-40\n  - Fig. A-50\n  - Fig. A-60\n  - Fig. A-70\n  - Fig. A-80\n  - Fig. A-90\n  - Fig. A-100\n  - Fig. A-110\n\n### Allowable Rear Encroachment Yard Section\nThis appears to be a separate summary or diagram-accompanied section on the right side of the page.\n\n- **Heading**: Allowable rear encroachment yard\n- **Text**:\n  - Rear yard encroachment: Provide the full sun.\n  - Width of the building, may extend into the rear yard, providing it is\n  - not less than 10' from any lot line.
