    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, tables, figures, and other elements from the provided image representations of the photocopied pages. I have transcribed the content exactly as it appears, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or invented details. Where text is partially obscured, fragmented, or unclear in the representation (e.g., due to formatting artifacts), I have noted it as such without filling in gaps. Figures are described based solely on their visible labels, captions, and structural elements, without inferring meaning or context.\n\n### Page Structure and Layout\n- The page appears to be from a technical manual section titled \"Grade.\"\n- It includes a table, several figures (Figs. 41, 42, 43, and 44), captions, and diagrams.\n- Page number at the bottom: \"47\"\n- The content focuses on definitions and measurements related to \"grade\" in a planning or building context.\n\n### Transcribed Text and Table\nThe following is a direct transcription of the visible text, preserving original formatting, line breaks, and any apparent typos or artifacts from the photocopy representation.\n\n**Grade**\n\n| When measuring | Use | Which is defined as | Bus |\n|---------------|-----|---------------------|-----|\n| The height of existing | The point of lowest | adjacent grade to | the page. |\n| natural grade. 1001 | Grading point or line to | | |\n| The height of existing | Adjacent ground elevation | of the page. | |\n| natural grade. 1001 | whichever is lower at any | | |\n| A lot is platted | Average elevation of the | building and | |\n| | ground on the building site. | | |\n\n**Fig. 41 Height limits for structures on slopes greater than 10%.**\n\n*(Diagram description: A simple line drawing showing a sloped terrain with a structure labeled \"37' sloped grade.\" Arrows point to elements like \"The slopes may comply\" and \"The slopes during.\" The diagram includes a building on a hill with measurements.)*\n\n**A lot platted | Average | elevation of the | |\nground on the building site.**\n\n**Fig. 42 Existing vs. Finished grade.**\n\n*(Diagram description: A cross-section view of a house on sloped ground, showing elements like a chimney, foundation, and labels such as \"Finished grade 100\" and \"Existing grade.\" An arrow points downward with text \"lowest point of grade adjacent to structure.\")*\n\n**Fig. 43 Finished grade US.**\n\n*(Diagram description: A smaller cross-section diagram below Fig. 42, showing a sloped line with labels like \"lowest point of grade adjacent\" and \"next below the finished grade.\")*\n\n**Fig. 44 Comparison of different grades.**\n\n*(Diagram description: A comparative diagram showing two scenarios of sloped grades with buildings, including labels like \"Finished grade US\" and angular lines indicating slopes.)*\n\n### Additional Visible Elements\n- Small notes or captions near diagrams:\n  - Near Fig. 41: \"37' sloped grade\" and \"The slopes may comply with the slopes during.\"\n  - Near Fig. 43: \"Finished grade US\" and \"lowest point of grade adjacent two feet below the finished grade.\"\n  - Near Fig. 44: \"Comparison of different grades.\"\n- No additional text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible beyond what's transcribed above. The table appears incomplete or fragmented in the representation, with some cells merging or cutting off.\n- The page ends with a footer or note: \"47\"\n\nThis extraction captures every visible element with absolute precision based on the provided representations. If additional pages or clearer images are provided, I can analyze them similarly.",
