    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, diagrams, and labels from the provided image. I have transcribed the content exactly as it appears, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or invented details. The image appears to depict instructional steps related to determining wall segments (e.g., open or closed status) in a building design context, possibly for zoning or setback regulations. I have organized the extraction into sections for clarity (e.g., based on steps and diagrams), but this organization is solely to reflect the layout in the image and does not imply any additional meaning.\n\n### Step 2 Text\nStep 2: Determine which perimeter about the house walls. These are closed segments, or sides.\n\n(In Fig A B C the wall house These are considered to be closed segments.)\n\n### Diagram Associated with Step 2\n- A small floor plan-like diagram showing an L-shaped structure.\n- Labels within the diagram:\n  - A (pointing to one segment)\n  - B (pointing to another segment)\n  - C (pointing to another segment)\n  - An arrow labeled \"1 ft\" pointing to a small extension or overhang.\n\n### Step 3 Text\nStep 3: Determine the status (open/closed) of the remaining segments based on the design. If at least 50% of the facade area is open from the segment side is considered open.\n\nFor purposes of measuring the setback from the top of the porch to the point where the segment brackets with the roof material.\n\n- The setback applies that are not measured from the same. Allowance may be made for architectural supports.\n\n### Diagram Associated with Step 3\n- A side-view diagram of a building structure (e.g., a gabled roof with porch-like elements).\n- Labels within the diagram:\n  - \"7'\" (vertical dimension on the left side).\n  - \"1 ft\" (horizontal dimension near the base on the left).\n  - \"2 ft\" (horizontal dimension near the base in the middle).\n  - \"6'\" (vertical dimension on the right side).\n  - \"Bracket 1 ft\" (label near a small protrusion).\n  - \"Open\" (label below the leftmost section).\n  - \"Closed wall\" (label below the middle section).\n  - \"Open\" (label below the rightmost section).\n  - \"Open\" (another label below an additional right section).\n\nNo additional text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible in the image beyond what is transcribed above. If more images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
