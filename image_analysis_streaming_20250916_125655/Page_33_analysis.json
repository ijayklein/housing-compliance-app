    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, diagrams, and other elements from the provided image of the photocopied page. I have transcribed the text exactly as it appears (including any apparent typos, abbreviations, or inconsistencies in the image), without adding, omitting, deducing, or interpreting any information. I have also described the diagrams factually based solely on their visible structure, labels, and elements, without inferring meaning or context. The extraction is organized by section for clarity, mirroring the layout of the page.\n\n### Top-Left Section (Figure and Diagram)\n- **Figure Caption:** Fig. 21 Plan view showing how to determine average grade\n- **Text Block:** When measuring height from the average grade of the plane closest to the building area\n- **Diagram Description:** A horizontal plan-view diagram divided into three rectangular sections, each depicting a building footprint with surrounding yards. The sections are arranged side-by-side and labeled as follows:\n  - Left section: Labeled \"Rear yard\" at the top, \"Side yard\" on the left and right, \"Front yard\" at the bottom. A central rectangular area is labeled \"Subject House\". A black dot is placed near the center-left of the \"Subject House\". A horizontal line spans the bottom with labels \"Rear lot line\", \"Required setback\", \"Buildable area\", \"Existing house\".\n  - Middle section: Similar to the left, with \"Rear yard\", \"Side yard\", \"Front yard\", and central \"Subject House\". A black dot is placed near the center.\n  - Right section: Similar to the others, with \"Rear yard\", \"Side yard\", \"Front yard\", and central \"Subject House\". A black dot is placed near the center-right.\n- **Additional Text in Diagram:** \n  - Above the diagrams: \"Inferior of the building and of the plane closest to the building area\"\n  - Arrow pointing to the left section: \"Average grade: The average of the grade of the structure from the\"\n  - Below the diagrams: A horizontal arrow labeled \"<--- Key line --->\"\n\n### Top-Right Section (Figure and Diagram)\n- **Figure Caption:** Fig. 22 Detailing allowable eaves projection\n- **Diagram Description:** A side-view diagram of a sloped roofline on a building. An angled line extends downward from the roof peak to the right, with a horizontal extension labeled \"1'\" (one foot) protruding from the roof edge. An arrow points to this extension.\n- **Additional Text in Diagram:**\n  - Next to the arrow: \"The daylight plane must be measured when horizontal eaves extend beyond the vertical wall.\"\n  - Below the diagram: \"Certification of daylight plane compliance: Unless required by the daylight plane provisions to structure shall provide a certification to the structure, built plans with the daylight plane provisions in Code by a licensed engineer, architect, or surveyor, and shall be provided prior to frame inspection. Sections 18.12.040(E)\"\n\n### Bottom-Right Section (Text Block)\n- **Text Block:** Certification of daylight plane compliance:  \n  Unless required by the daylight plane provisions to structure shall provide a certification to the structure, built plans with the daylight plane provisions in Code by a licensed engineer, architect, or surveyor, and shall be provided prior to frame inspection. Sections 18.12.040(E)\n\n### Page Footer\n- **Page Number:** 27\n\nNo additional text, rules, regulations, specifications, or elements are visible in the image beyond what is extracted above. The page appears to be from a technical manual related to building or zoning (based solely on the visible content), but I am not deducing or expanding on this. If more images or pages are provided, I can extract from them similarly.",
