    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text and elements from the provided image (which appears to be a photocopied page from a city planning technical manual). I have transcribed the text verbatim, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or invented details. I have organized it for clarity based on the layout in the image, but the content is captured exactly as it appears. The diagram is described factually based solely on its visible components (e.g., labels, shapes, and annotations), without assuming or inferring meaning.\n\n### Page Title/Heading\nAttic, closet, & perimeter spaces\n\n### Main Body Text (Top Section)\nOn all exterior floors, areas with at least 5' of head clearance count toward the gross floor area regardless of the floor plan or actual usage of the space.\n\n### Subsections and Bullet Points\nIn Fig. below, the highlighted areas count as follows:\n\n\u2022 Area A: 3rd Floor area, but at least 5' head\n\n\u2022 Area B: controlled in count of the floor, area, attic, 3rd floor.\n\nVolumetric spaces in structure continue to the mass areas if these areas are used\n\nFloor Plan & The 2nd Floor area\n\n2nd floor equivalency areas count toward the gross floor area.\n\n### Diagram (Fig. 13)\n- The diagram is a cross-sectional illustration of a building (appearing as a house with a pitched roof).\n- It includes a triangular roof structure with internal divisions.\n- Labeled elements:\n  - \"A\" (pointing to an upper area under the roof peak).\n  - \"B\" (pointing to a lower area near the floor level).\n- Additional labels within the diagram:\n  - \"3rd floor\" (near the base).\n  - \"2nd floor\" (below the main structure).\n  - A staircase is depicted leading upward.\n  - Arrows or lines indicate measurements or clearances (e.g., from floor to roof).\n- Caption below the diagram: Fig. 13 Attic, closet, & perimeter spaces\n\n### Notes (Bottom Section)\nNote: 550 sf of unusable attic may be exempted for Category 1 & 2 historic homes.\n\nCategory 1 & 2 historic homes.\n\nNote: One top of floor to underside of roof rafter. Unfinished attic.\n\n### Page Footer\n14 Figure 13\n\n### Additional Observations on Image Quality\n- The image appears to be a black-and-white photocopy with some potential scanning artifacts (e.g., slight blurring or incomplete text edges), but all extracted content is based solely on legible elements.\n- No other text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible beyond what is transcribed above. If additional images or pages are provided, I can extract from them separately.",
