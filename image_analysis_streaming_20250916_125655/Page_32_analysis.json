    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible text, labels, and descriptive elements from the provided image of the photocopied page. I have captured only what is explicitly present in the image, organized by section for clarity (e.g., headings, body text, figure captions, diagram labels). I have not added, inferred, or deduced any information, rules, regulations, or specifications beyond what is directly shown. Any unclear or partially obscured elements (due to the photocopy quality) are noted as such without interpretation.\n\n### Page Heading\n- Daylight plane\n\n### Subheading\n- Primary daylight plane (sides)\n\n### Main Body Text\n- The primary daylight plane regulates structures located within the buildable area.\n- Structures located in the rear and/or side yards are regulated by the accessory structure daylight plane described on the next page.\n\n### Figure Caption\n- Fig. 20 Front elevation showing side primary daylight plane.\n\n### Diagram Elements and Labels\n- (Diagram depicts a side view of a house with a sloped line extending from the ground upward, labeled as a daylight plane. There are measurements and annotations visible on the diagram.)\n  - Arrow pointing to the sloped line: 45\u00b0\n  - Measurement along the base: 35'\n  - Measurement upward: 35'\n- Additional text block near the left side of the diagram:\n  - The daylight plane in conjunction with height & invisible tent\n  - Intended to contain development on the lot to privacy and exposure to natural light.\n  - Figure something Table 2\n  - Ground grade\n  - The point nearest\n  - For grading the wall or located of the wall\n- Labels within the diagram:\n  - Note: Daylight plane is measured from average grade.\n  - Grade below any point 10 ft. Fig. A(2)\n  - Free daylight plane measured at roof eave.\n- Bottom-right text:\n  - 26\n\nNo other text, rules, regulations, or technical specifications are visible in the image. The diagram appears to illustrate a conceptual \"daylight plane\" with angular and dimensional constraints, but I have not interpreted or expanded on its meaning.",
