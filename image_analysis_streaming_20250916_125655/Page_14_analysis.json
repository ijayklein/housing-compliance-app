    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible content from the provided image of the photocopied page from the city planning technical manual. I have transcribed the text verbatim (including any apparent typos, abbreviations, or incomplete sentences based on what's shown) and described the diagrams and illustrations factually, without adding, deducing, or interpreting any information. The content appears to focus on technical specifications for determining if a roofed porch on the first floor meets an openness criterion (e.g., at least 50% open), likely as part of zoning or building regulations. I have structured the extraction for clarity, mirroring the layout of the page as closely as possible.\n\n### Page Title\nRoofed Porches on the 1st Floor\n\n[Blank horizontal gray bar spanning the width of the page, possibly a separator or header graphic.]\n\n### Main Instructional Text\nHow to Determine if a Porch is at least 50% open. (using Fig 1 as an example)\n\n### Figure and Illustration (Left Side)\nFig 1. Roofed 1st floor Porch\n\n[3D grayscale illustration of a single-story house with a roofed porch attached to the front. The house has a gabled roof, windows, and a door visible on the main structure. The porch is covered by an extension of the main roof and appears to have open sides. No labels or measurements are directly on this illustration.]\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions and Diagram (Right Side)\nStep 1: Determine the perimeter of the porch and divide it into open segments.\n\nThe perimeter of the porch is shown below. It is the sum of segments A through G. The below is the sum of\n\n[2D grayscale diagram of an L-shaped porch structure, viewed from above or in plan view, with labeled line segments along its perimeter. The diagram shows a right-angled corner with measurements and labels as follows:\n- Vertical segment labeled \"A\" with a measurement of \"4'\".\n- Horizontal segment labeled \"B\" with a measurement of \"8'\".\n- Vertical segment labeled \"C\" with a measurement of \"4'\".\n- The diagram appears to continue with additional segments (potentially D through G), but they are not fully visible or labeled in the provided image. Arrows and dashed lines indicate divisions or measurements.\n- No additional text or calculations are visible in this diagram.]\n\n### Additional Notes on the Page\n- The page ends abruptly after the diagram and the incomplete sentence in the Step 1 text.\n- There is a small page number or marker \"1\" at the bottom left, possibly indicating this is page 1 of a section.\n- No other zoning rules, regulations, or technical specifications are visible beyond what's extracted above. The content seems to be the beginning of a multi-step process, but only Step 1 is shown.\n\nIf you provide additional images or pages from the manual, I can extract from them in the same manner.",
