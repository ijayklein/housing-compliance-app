    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible and legible content from the provided image (which appears to be a photocopied page from a city planning technical manual). I have transcribed the text exactly as it appears, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or assumptions. I have also described the diagrams and figures in a neutral, factual manner based solely on their visible elements, including labels and dimensions. No information has been invented or inferred.\n\n### Page Layout and Content\n- **Page Header/Title**:  \n  Carport Standards\n\n- **Figure Caption (centered below title)**:  \n  Fig 29 Parking dimensions for carport in plan view\n\n- **Diagrams**:  \n  The page contains three diagrams, arranged as follows:  \n  - **Left Diagram (Plan View)**:  \n    - A top-down (plan) view of a carport structure.  \n    - Depicts a rectangular area with a car positioned inside.  \n    - Labels and dimensions:  \n      - \"One of two columns\" (pointing to a vertical line on the left side).  \n      - A horizontal dimension line labeled \"20'\" spanning the width of the carport opening.  \n      - \"Plan View\" label at the bottom.  \n    - Additional elements: A dashed line labeled \"Eaves/ceiling\" extending from the structure.\n\n  - **Top-Right Diagram (Side Elevation)**:  \n    - A side view of a carport with a car underneath.  \n    - Labels and dimensions:  \n      - \"One of two columns\" (pointing to a vertical support).  \n      - \"Bottom cord\" (pointing to a slanted roof element).  \n      - A horizontal dimension line labeled \"20' open\" spanning the open side of the carport.  \n      - \"Side elevation\" label (not explicitly shown in this diagram, but implied by context; the label appears in the bottom-right diagram).\n\n  - **Bottom-Right Diagram (Front and Side Elevations)**:  \n    - Two sub-views: A front elevation and a left side elevation.  \n    - **Left Side Elevation** (labeled as such):  \n      - Shows a car under a slanted roof.  \n      - Labels and dimensions:  \n        - A vertical dimension line labeled \"7' min.\" from the ground to the roof edge.  \n        - \"Left Side Elevation\" label.  \n    - **Front Elevation** (labeled as such):  \n      - Shows a car under a roof with supports.  \n      - Labels and dimensions:  \n        - \"One of two columns\" (pointing to a vertical support).  \n        - \"Bottom cord\" (pointing to a slanted roof element).  \n        - A horizontal dimension line labeled \"20'\" spanning the width.\n\n- **Page Footer**:  \n  - Page number: 35 (centered at the bottom).\n\n### Additional Notes on Extraction\n- The page has a gray shaded header bar under the title.  \n- All diagrams include simple line drawings of a car (sedan-like shape) for scale.  \n- No additional text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible beyond what is transcribed above. The content is limited to the title, figure caption, diagrams, labels, and dimensions as shown.  \n- The image appears to be a single page (page 35), with no visible references to surrounding pages or additional context.  \n\nIf you provide more images or pages, I can extract from them in the same manner.",
