    "raw_content": "Below is a precise extraction of all visible and legible text, diagrams, and other elements from the provided page (which appears to be a photocopied or scanned excerpt from a city planning technical manual). I have transcribed the content exactly as it appears, without any additions, deductions, interpretations, or invented details. Where text is partially obscured, garbled, or unclear (e.g., due to potential scanning artifacts or formatting in the input), I have noted it as such but have not filled in gaps. Diagrams are described based solely on visible labels and structures, without assuming or inferring additional meaning.\n\n### Page Structure and Metadata\n- **Page Number**: 15 (visible in the bottom-right corner).\n- **Overall Layout**: The page includes a main title, explanatory text, two labeled diagrams (Roof Plan 1 and Roof Plan 2), figure references (Fig. 1B), and a note at the bottom. Diagrams appear to illustrate building cross-sections or plans with labeled areas (A, B, C) and arrows or lines indicating measurements or boundaries.\n\n### Extracted Text (Transcribed Verbatim)\n- **Main Title**: Balconies, decks, & outdoor areas on upper floors\n- **Subtitle/Introductory Text**: \n  - Outdoor areas on upper levels that are roofed DO count toward gross floor area regardless of the design (including whether or not the sides are open).\n- **Explanatory Paragraph**:\n  - An outdoor area on upper floors is considered to be roofed if the area above that area is deeper than the area covering the rest of the floor. This may be illustrated by Roof Plan 1 & 2 of Fig. 1B.\n- **Figure Reference**: Fig. 1B Balconies.\n- **Note at Bottom**: Notes: Project-out balconies are not subject to the same evaluation.\n\n### Diagram Descriptions (Based Solely on Visible Elements)\nThe page includes two diagrams, each with a label, a simple line-drawing illustration of a building structure (e.g., side view or plan view with roof and floor elements), and annotations for specific areas. No measurements, scales, or additional unmarked details are visible or extractable. I describe them precisely as presented.\n\n1. **Roof Plan 1**:\n   - **Diagram Illustration**: A side-view sketch of a building with a protruding upper-floor area labeled with an arrow pointing to \"Roof Plan 1\". The structure shows a roofline extending over part of the building, with labeled sections (A and C visible).\n   - **Annotations**:\n     - Area A Counts because it is roofed (a relatively open area).\n     - Area C: Does not count because the nothing is above the area. (Note: The phrasing \"the nothing is above the area\" appears exactly as shown and may be a scanning artifact or typo; no deduction is made.)\n     - (Area B is not explicitly labeled or annotated in this diagram.)\n\n2. **Roof Plan 2**:\n   - **Diagram Illustration**: A side-view or L-shaped plan sketch of a building with a roofline and labeled sections (A, B, and possibly C). It includes a horizontal measurement line with \"Width of floor\" noted, and areas marked with letters inside boxed or outlined regions.\n   - **Annotations**:\n     - Area A Counts because the roofed area is greater than the parking. (Note: The word \"parking\" appears exactly as shown and may refer to a specific context; no deduction is made.)\n     - Area B: Does not count because it's open.\n     - (Area C is visible in the diagram but not explicitly annotated here; it aligns with the structure from Roof Plan 1.)\n\nNo additional text, rules, regulations, or specifications are visible beyond what is transcribed above. The content focuses on zoning rules related to how roofed outdoor areas on upper floors contribute to gross floor area calculations, with illustrations distinguishing between areas that \"count\" and those that do not based on roofing depth and openness. If this is part of a larger manual, this extraction is limited to the single provided page.",
