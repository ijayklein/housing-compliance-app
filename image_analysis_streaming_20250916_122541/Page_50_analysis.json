(see table)\n* Maximum size is 450 sf (basement area counts towards the size of the 2nd-dwelling unit even if it does not count toward total gross floor area.)\n* Maximum height is 17'.\n* Must have two parking spaces (one to be covered).\n* Maximum size for covered parking is 200 sf. (This is in addition to the 450 sf allowed for the 2nd-dwelling unit.)\n* Except on corner lots, entrance way shall not face same lot line as entrance to main dwelling.\n* Exterior staircases to 2nd floor units shall be located toward interior side or rear yard.\n* Must be located within the setbacks just like the main dwelling. (Fig 41 on p. 45)\n* Counts towards total FAR for the lot\n\n**Detached units** (Fig 41 A-D on p. 45)\n* Lot size must meet minimum for zone (see table)\n* Maximum size is 900 sf (basement area counts towards the size of the 2nd-dwelling unit even if it does not count toward total gross floor area.)\n* Maximum height is one story and 17'\n* Must share driveway with main dwelling\n* Must have two parking spaces (one to be covered)\n* Maximum size for covered parking is 200 sf. (This is in addition to the 900 sf allowed for the 2nd-dwelling unit.)\n* Must be architecturally compatible with main dwelling.\n* Must be located 12' from the main dwelling.\n* Must be located within the setbacks just like the main dwelling.

See \"Site planning for attached garages/carports\" and \"Site planning for detached garages/carports\" in the \"Parking\" section of this manual. Note that parking for the 2nd dwelling unit may be combined with parking for the main residence e.g., a two-car garage as shown in Fig 23 C & D.\n\n**Code sections**\nPage 44\n18.12.070 (b) (1 & 2)\nTable 5\n18.12.070 (c, d, e, & f)\nPage 45\n18.12.080 (d, e, & f)"
