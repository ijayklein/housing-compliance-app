Structures located in the rear and/or side yards are regulated by the accessory-structure daylight plan described on the next page.\n\n**Figure Caption:**\nFig 20 Front elevation showing side primary daylight plane\n\n**Code sections:**\n*   Page 26\n    *   18.12.040 (a) Table 2\n*   Page 27\n    *   18.04\n*   Page 28\n    *   18.12.040 (c) Table 2\n*   Page 29\n    *   18.12.050 (b) (2)\n    *   18.12.040 (j)\n\n**Page Number:** 26\n\n**Diagram Labels and Measurements:**\n*   **Angle:** 45\u00b0\n*   **Vertical Measurement from average grade:** 10\u2032 from average grade\n*   **Vertical Measurement for protrusions:** 24\u2032 max. for protrusions\n*   **Vertical Measurement:** Max. building height (indicated by an asterisk *)\n*   **Line Labels:**\n    *   Side lot line (appears twice)\n    *   Average grade\n    *   Max. allowed is Min. required by Building Code (pointing to a vertical measurement)\n\n**Diagram Notes:**\n*   Daylight plane is measured from average grade.\n*   Average grade is established using existing grade\u2014before any grading or fill (See Fig 44 p. 42)\n*   Side daylight plane is measured (up) at lot line.\n*   Rear daylight plane is measured (up) at rear setback.\n\n**Additional Labels on Diagram:**\n*   Grade at the nearest point on the adjacent lot\n*   Existing grade of the structure (at midpoint of wall)"
