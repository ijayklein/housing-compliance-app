(incl project lot)**\n    *   **Note:** If block is more than 600' long, consider only lots within 600' (max. 10 lots).\n\n2.  **If Yes (to step 1), Exclude the following types of lots:**\n    *   Flag lot (C)\n    *   Multi-family use w/ 3+ units (G)\n    *   Corner lot facing cross street (H)\n\n3.  **Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?**\n\n4.  **If Yes (to step 3), Exclude the smallest and largest setbacks:**\n    *   Smallest (D)\n    *   Largest (E)\n\n5.  **Find the average of the remaining lots (incl. subject lot). If greater than 30', it applies.**\n\n**Example Calculation (from image):**\n30 (A)\n33 (B)\n+ 35 (F)\n---\n98 \u00f7 3 = 32.7\n\n**Fig 15 Example of a block with a contextual setback of 32.7'**\n\n**Diagram Elements and Setbacks:**\n*   **Lot A:** Single-Family, 30' setback\n*   **Lot B:** Single-Family, 33' setback\n*   **Lot C:** Flag lot (excluded from calculation)\n*   **Lot D:** Single-Family, 20' setback (identified as smallest, excluded from calculation)\n*   **Lot E:** Single-Family, 37' setback (identified as largest, excluded from calculation)\n*   **Lot F:** Single-Family, 35' setback\n*   **Lot G:** Multiple-Family (3+ units) (excluded from calculation)\n*   **Lot H:** Lot fronts onto other street / Street sideyard (excluded from calculation)\n\n**Key (Legend):**\n*   Lot line (dashed line)\n*   Sidewalk (hatched pattern)\n*   Curb (thick solid line)\n*   Required setbacks (dashed line with square corners)\n*   Buildable area (light gray shaded area)\n*   Existing house (dark gray/black solid shape)"
