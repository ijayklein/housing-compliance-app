However purposes, the lot is defined by the edge of the public street easement or public right-of-way (ROW). Dimensions for the public ROW are available at the Development Center.\n*   **Label A** points to a section within the Public ROW.\n\n**Fig 2 Gross lot area exclusions: flag-lot \"poles\"**\n\n*   **Flag lot accessed via private easement**\n*   **Flag lot with \"pole\"**\n*   **'pole\" portion of a lot must be subtracted the gross lot size**\n*   **Label B** indicates the \"pole\" portion of the flag lot.\n*   **Note:** Private access easements that provide access to lots are NOT subtracted the lot on which they occur.\n*   **Street** is indicated at the bottom of the diagram.\n\n**Fig 3 Gross lot area exclusions: creek easements**\n\n*   **Label C** indicates the creek channel.\n*   **Creek easement** is labeled.\n*   **Top of bank** is labeled.\n*   **Lot with creek and/or creek easement** is labeled.\n*   **The portion of the lot within a creek channel must be subtracted from gross lot size.**\n*   **Note:** The channel or area to be subtracted is defined by Santa Clara Valley Water District's easement or, if there is no easement, the top-of-bank. Determining the top-of-bank may require a surveyor.\n*   **Street** is indicated at the bottom of the diagram.\n\n**Key**\n\n*   **Curb** (represented by a solid line)\n*   **Sidewalk** (represented by a patterned rectangle)\n*   **Lot lines** (represented by dashed lines)\n*   **Creek** (represented by wavy lines)\n*   **Area that must be subtracted from gross lot area** (represented by a shaded area)\n\n**Page Number:** 3"
