Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured.\n\n**Examples (from Fig 12):**\nIn the examples of Fig 12 below the highlighted areas count as follows:\n\n*   **Area A**\n    *   once as 1st floor,\n    *   again as 2nd floor, and\n    *   a third time as 3rd-floor equivalency\n\n*   **Area B**\n    *   once as 1st floor,\n    *   again as 2nd-floor equivalency\n\n**Note:**\n200 sf of 3rd floor equivalency may be exempted where roof pitch is 4:12 or steeper (see \"Height\" section).\n\n**Figure Caption:**\nFig 12 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\n\n**Labels and Measurements from Diagrams:**\n\n*   **Diagram 1 (Left):**\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency\" (indicated by a double-headed arrow)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency\" (indicated by a double-headed arrow)\n    *   \"Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\" (pointing to the hatched area above the second floor)\n    *   \"Top of roof material (Typical)\" (pointing to the top of the roof)\n    *   \"26'\" (indicating a height from an unmarked reference line to the top of the roof material)\n    *   \"17'\" (indicating a height from an unmarked reference line to a lower point on the roof structure)\n    *   \"A\" (label for a hatched vertical section)\n    *   \"B\" (label for another hatched vertical section, including a staircase)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd floor\" (indicated by a double-headed arrow at the first floor level)\n    *   \"1st flr\" (label for the first floor)\n    *   \"Top of finished floor (Typical)\" (pointing to the top of the first floor)\n\n*   **Diagram 2 (Right):**\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency\" (indicated by a double-headed arrow)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency\" (indicated by a double-headed arrow)\n    *   \"Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\" (pointing to the hatched area above the second floor)\n    *   \"26'\" (indicating a height from an unmarked reference line to the top of the roof material)\n    *   \"17'\" (indicating a height from an unmarked reference line to a lower point on the roof structure)\n    *   \"A\" (label for a hatched vertical section)\n    *   \"B\" (label for another hatched vertical section)\n    *   \"Vaulted ceiling space\" (pointing to a hatched area within section B)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd floor\" (indicated by a double-headed arrow at the first floor level)\n    *   \"1st fl\" (label for the first floor)\n\n**Page Number:** 17"
