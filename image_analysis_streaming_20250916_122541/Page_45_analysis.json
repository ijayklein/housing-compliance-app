See Figs 25-26 p. 32.\n\n**Figure Title:** Fig 34 Examples of site planning solutions for detached garages/carports\n\n**Notes:**\n*   **Note:** Uncovered spaces must be located beyond the required front-yard and beyond the first 10' of the street-side yard.\n*   **Note:** In all the examples on this page, a 1-car garage could be substituted for a 2-car garage because there is room for uncovered parking in the driveway.\n\n**Callouts/Labels within the diagrams:**\n*   Garages at the lot line must comply with Uniform Building Code (UBC) requirements for fire-rated walls & roof materials.\n*   Carports with open sides must be at least 3' from any lot line.\n*   3' min.
