Therefore, if basement area is below grade and does not contribute to the apparent mass of a building, that area, even if it is habitable, need not be included in the total floor area.\n\n**Basement standards**\n*   May not be located in special flood hazard areas.\n*   May not extend beyond building footprint.\n*   May not encroach into required yards, except where main dwelling is permitted to extend into rear yard.\n\n**FAR**\nBasements (even habitable ones) do not count as floor area if first floor is no more than 3' above grade.\n\n**Fig 35 Basement & grade**\n\n**Excavated features**\nThere are two types of excavated features:\n*   Light wells and stairwells\n*   Below-grade patios\n\n**FAR**\nExcavation will not affect grade or measurement of floor area if standards are met (see pages 42 and 43).\n\n**Fig 36 Excavated feature & grade**\n\n**A:** distance between top of first floor and grade if excavation meets the size/dimensional limits described in Figs 39-40 on pp. 42-43.\n\n**B:** distance between top of first floor and grade if excavated features exceed the size/dimensional limits described in Figs 39-40 on pp. 42-43.\n\n**Code sections**\nPage 40\n18.12.090 (a, b, & c)\nPage 41\n18.12.090 (c)\nPage 43\n18.12.090 (c) (1)\nPage 44\n18.12.090 (c) (2)\n\n**Diagram Labels:**\n*   Top of first floor\n*   Basement\n*   Excavated feature\n*   Grade if excavated features meet standards described in Figs 39-40 on pp. 42-43.\n*   Grade if excavated features exceed standards described in Figs 39-40 on pp. 42-43.\n\n**Page Number:** 40"
