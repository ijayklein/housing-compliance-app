It is the sum of segments A through G. It is 70 linear feet.\n\n**Measurements from the diagram:**\n*   Segment A: 3'\n*   Segment B: 8'\n*   Segment C: 4' (This measurement is partially obscured, but based on its position relative to A and B, and the overall context, it appears to be 4'.)\n*   Segment D: 7'\n*   Segment E: 14'\n*   Segment F: 24'\n*   Segment G: 10' (This measurement is associated with the segment labeled 'C' in the diagram, but the text refers to segments A through G and the label 'C' in the diagram has a value of 10'. The text also refers to a segment 'C' with a value of 4'. This is a discrepancy between the text and the diagram labels. I will list both as they appear.)\n\n**Page Number:** 8"
