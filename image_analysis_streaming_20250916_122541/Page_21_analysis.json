This may be illustrated by comparing Roof Plans 1 & 2 of Fig 10.\n\nFig 10 Balconies\n\nRoof Plan 1\nArea A: Counts because it is roofed\nArea B: Does not count because this arbor is substantially open\nArea C: Does not count because the overhang is the same size as the overhang around the rest of the house and is considered to be open\n\nRoof Plan 2\nArea A: Counts because it is roofed\nArea B: Counts because the overhang here is greater than the overhang around the rest of the house, and considered to be roofed\nArea C: Does not count because it is open\n\nNote: Pop-out balconies are subject to the same evaluation.\n\n15"
