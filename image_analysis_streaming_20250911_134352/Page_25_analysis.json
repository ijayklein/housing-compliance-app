They count towards lot coverage always, regardless of size.\n\nMiscellaneous appendages e.g., tool sheds, equipment enclosures, play houses, etc., that are greater than 5' in height, DO COUNT toward gross floor area. (Note: Neither appendages like this nor noise-producing equipment may be located in the required yards.)\n\nNote: In 2000, the city of Palo Alto passed an ordinance prohibiting the construction of new wood-burning fireplaces.
