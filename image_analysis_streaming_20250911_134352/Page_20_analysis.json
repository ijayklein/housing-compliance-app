If the porch space is higher, the area will count again as 2nd story equivalency.\n\nFig 9 Recessed porches on the 1st floor\n\nA This example complies with all three criteria and does NOT count toward gross floor area.\n\nB This example violates two of the three criteria.\n\u2022 the porch depth is greater than 10' and\n\u2022 the porch ceiling is above the 2nd floor\nTherefore it DOES count toward gross floor area and if it is higher than 17\" it will count twice (see note).\n\n14",
