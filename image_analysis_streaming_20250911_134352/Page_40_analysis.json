Therefore, a two-car garage or carport to be 20' x 20' clear inside.\n\n\u2022 Minimum vertical clearance: 7'.\n\n* Clear area for parking space must be free of other uses e.g., water heaters, clothes washers or dryer, bicycle parking facilities, etc.\n\nFig 28 Parking space dimensions for garage and uncovered space in plan view",
