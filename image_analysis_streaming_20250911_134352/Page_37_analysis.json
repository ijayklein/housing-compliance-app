A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 7.5' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.\n\nFig 24 Examples of site planning solutions for accessory structures\n\nA Combo garage/small pool cabana (side by side)\n\u2022 Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n  a. be at least 7.5' from the front lot line\n  b. be no more than 12' high\n  c. comply with accessory-structure daylight plane.
