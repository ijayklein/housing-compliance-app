This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right:\n\n\u2022 Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls.\n\u2022 A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.\n\nOpen                     Open\n\n10",
