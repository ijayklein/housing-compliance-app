Development potential is based on the net lot area and while gross and net lot area are the same for most lots in Palo Alto, there are some lots for which portions must be excluded from the gross lot area to establish the net lot area.\n\nAreas excluded from the gross lot size are:\n\u2022 Street right-of-way (Area A of Fig 1 on this page)\n\u2022 \"Pole\" portion of a flag lot (Area B of Fig 2 on this page)\n\u2022 Creek channel (Area C of Fig 3 on this page)\n\nFig 1 Gross lot area exclusions: street easements\n\nThe portion of the lot within the public ROW must be subtracted from the gross lot area.\n\nNotes: In some areas of Palo Alto, like Barron Park, it is not unusual for the lot to extend to the middle of the street. However, for zoning purposes, the lot is defined by the edge of the public street easement or public right-of-way (ROW). Dimensions for the public ROW are available at the Development Center.\n\nFig 2 Gross lot area exclusions: flag-lot \"poles\"\n\nFlag lot containing private easement\nFlag lot with \"pole\"\n\"pole\" portion of a lot must be subtracted from the gross lot size\n\n* Private access easements to that provide access to lots are NOT subtracted from the lot on which they occur.\n\nStreet\n\nFig 3 Gross lot area exclusions: creek easements\n\nCreek easement\n\nThe portion of the lot within a creek channel must be subtracted from gross lot size.\n\nTop of bank\n\nLot with creek and/or creek easement\n\nNotes: The channel or area to be subtracted is defined by Santa Clara Valley Water District's easement or, if there is no easement, the top-of-bank. Determining the top-of-bank may require a surveyor.\n\nKey\nCurb\nSidewalk\nLot lines\n\nCreek\nArea that must be subtracted from gross lot area\n\nStreet\n\n3",
