## Title
* Detached 2nd-dwelling units & associated parking site planning

## Figure caption
* **Figure 41** Examples of site planning solutions for detached 2nd dwelling units and associated required parking

## Scenario A
Heading
* A Detached & separate from main-dwelling parking
## Bulleted text
* Main dwelling has a 1-car attached garage.
* 2nd dwelling has a 1-car detached garage. (Because it is detached and at least 75' from the front lot line, it may be located in the rear and side yards.)
* Both dwellings use driveway for their uncovered spaces (beyond front setback)
## Diagram labels visible in this panel
* Interior lot example
* Rear yard
* Front yard
* Main dwelling
* Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max
* 1-car detached (small garage symbol at rear; additional small text appears to read “200 sf max” but the “200” is faint)
* 1-car attached (at the main dwelling)
* Buildable area
* A vertical dimension arrow in the rear yard labeled “—' min.” The number is not fully legible in the scan.

## Scenario B
Heading
* B Attached & separate from main-dwelling parking
## Bulleted text
* Main dwelling has 1-car attached garage.
* 2nd dwelling has a 1-car attached garage. (Because attached, it must be located with the building area rather than in the rear or side yards.)
* Both dwellings use driveway for their uncovered spaces (beyond front setback)
## Diagram labels visible in this panel
* Interior lot example
* Rear yard
* Front yard
* Main dwelling
* Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max
* 1-car attached (small label near the 2nd unit; additional small text appears to read “200 sf max” but the “200” is faint)
* 1-car attached (at the main dwelling)
* Buildable area
* A vertical dimension arrow in the rear yard labeled “—' min.” The number is not fully legible in the scan.

## Scenario C
Heading
* C Detached & combined with main-dwelling parking
## Bulleted text
* Both dwellings share a 2-car detached garage. (Because it is detached and at least 75' from the front lot line, it may be located in the rear and side yards.)
* Both dwellings use the driveway for their respective uncovered spaces (beyond front setback)
## Diagram labels visible in this panel
* Interior lot example
* Rear yard
* Front yard
* Main dwelling
* Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max
* 2-car detached for both dwellings (garage at rear)
* Buildable area
* A vertical dimension arrow in the rear yard labeled “—' min.” The number is not fully legible in the scan.

## Scenario D
Heading
* D Combined w/ main-dwelling parking that is attached to main dwelling
## Bulleted text
* Both dwellings share a 2-car attached garage.
* Both dwellings use the driveway for their respective uncovered spaces (beyond front setback)
## Diagram labels visible in this panel
* Interior lot example
* Rear yard
* Front yard
* Main dwelling
* Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max
* 2-car attached garage for both dwellings (at the main dwelling)
* Buildable area
* A vertical dimension arrow in the rear yard labeled “—' min.” The number is not fully legible in the scan.

Key (legend)
* Curb
* Lot line
* Sidewalk
* Required setbacks
* Buildable area
* Dwelling
* 2nd-dwelling unit & associated pkg
* Area that may not be used to satisfy required parking spaces
* Uncovered space

Other visible repeated labels/elements
* “Interior lot example” appears above each diagram.
* “Rear yard,” “Front yard,” and “Buildable area” appear in each diagram.
* Each 2nd unit is labeled “Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max.”
* Page number at bottom right: 45

## Notes on legibility
* The minimum dimension noted with a vertical arrow in the rear yard reads “—' min.” The first digits are not reliably legible in the scan, so the exact number cannot be confirmed from this image.
* Small text next to the single-car garage symbols in A and B likely reads “200 sf max,” but the number is faint; because legibility is limited, this value cannot be confirmed with certainty from this image alone.
