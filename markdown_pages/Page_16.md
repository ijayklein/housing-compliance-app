## Header
* Step 4: Finalize the determination of which segments are closed and which are open, total the linear feet in each category, and compare the totals.
* For the porch in **Figure 5**, the summary is as follows:

## Summary of segments and lengths
* Closed
* Segment A: 3'
* Segment B: 8'
* Segment C: 10'
* Segment E: 14'
* Total closed: 35'
* Open
* Segment D: 7'
* Segment F: 24'
* Segment G: 4'
* Total open: 35'

Legend (from diagram)
* Closed segments
* Open segments

## Diagram callouts visible on plan
* D: 7'
* E: 14'
* F: 24'
* C: 10'
* B: 8'
* G: 4'
* Additional dimension callouts: 2', 2' (two separate notations near the left side)

## Conclusion
* The perimeter of the porch in **Figure 5** is 50% open and so the porch would NOT count toward gross floor area

Note (verbatim)
* Note: If a porch floor is more than 30" above grade, the porch sides may need to be 36" high for safety reasons. This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right:
 • Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls.
 • A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.
