* Lot coverage & floor area
* These terms are used to describe the amount of development on a lot.
* Lot coverage describes how much of the lot is covered by structures but doesn’t evaluate the mass of those structures.
* Gross floor area describes the mass of the structures by reflecting the cumulative square footage of all visible levels.
* ### Code Sections

* 18.12.040 (b) Table 3
* 18.04.030 (a) (86)

## Lot coverage
* Maximum allowable
* Allowable lot coverage is expressed by a ratio—35% of the lot size.
* Example calculation:
* For a 7,000 sf lot, the allowable lot coverage would be:
* 0.35 x 7,000 sf = 2,450 sf
* Lot coverage includes:
* footprints of all structures including main residence, covered parking, tool sheds, covered pool equipment units, etc.
* projecting elements such as balconies, stairways, porches, patio covers, etc.
* decking that exceeds 30” above grade.
* for roof overhangs or eaves that exceed 4’, the portion that is beyond 4’.
* swimming pools and spas that exceed 30” above grade.
* Lot coverage excludes:
* roof overhangs up to 4’.
* uncovered structures less than 30” above grade.
* An additional 5% coverage is permitted for covered patios, canopies and roof overhangs beyond 4 feet.
* Note: To qualify as a structure that is less than 30 inches above grade, a porch or deck may only have open railings above 30 inches—no solid half walls.

## Gross Floor area
* Maximum allowable
* Allowable gross floor area is expressed by a ratio—the sum of 45% of the first 5,000 sf of lot area plus 30% of any portion of lot area in excess of 5,000 sf.
* Example calculation:
* For a 7,000 sf lot, the allowable gross floor area would be:
* 0.45 x 5,000 sf = 2,250 sf
* 0.30 x 2,000 sf = 600 sf
* Total = 2,850 sf
* Gross floor area includes:
* the sum of all the floors in a main structure measured to the outside of the exterior stud walls.
* stairwells at all floors and all areas that are greater than 50% enclosed and covered.
* covered parking and all accessory buildings which are greater than 120 square feet.
* spaces that meet the criteria for second and third floor equivalents.
* Note: The main house may not exceed 6,000 sf, regardless of the size of the lot.
