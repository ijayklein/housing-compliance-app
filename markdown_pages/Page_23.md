Title
* 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency

Primary rule (verbatim)
* Areas higher than 17' and 26' above the first floor (that do not already count as floor area e.g., open atrium spaces and inaccessible attic spaces), count toward the gross floor area in the form of 2nd and 3rd floor equivalency regardless of the floor plan or usage of the space. Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured.

## Examples statement
* In the examples of **Figure 12** below the highlighted areas count as follows:

## Area A
* once as 1st floor,
* again as 2nd floor, and
* a third time as 3rd floor equivalency

## Area B
* once as 1st floor,
* again as 2nd floor equivalency

Note (verbatim)
* 200 sf of 3rd floor equivalency may be exempted where roof pitch is 4:12 or steeper (see “Height” section).
