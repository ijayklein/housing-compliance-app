* Heading: Parking space standards
* Bulleted standards:
* Two spaces are required on the lot (per dwelling).
* They may NOT be located in the required front yard or, first 10 ft of, required street side yard.
* 2nd dwelling units have same requirements.
* No underground parking garages except by variance.
* One of the two spaces must be covered.
* To be considered detached, a covered-parking structure must be a minimum of 3' from the main dwelling.
* Minimum size for an uncovered space is 8.5' x 18'.
* Minimum clearance inside a covered parking structure to be 10' x 20' for each space. Therefore, a two-car garage or carport to be 20' x 20' clear inside.
* Minimum vertical clearance: 7'.
* Clear area for parking space must be free of other uses e.g., water heaters, clothes washers or dryer, bicycle parking facilities, etc.
