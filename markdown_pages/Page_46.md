## Left column text
* Floor area regulations are intended to address the building mass and the appearance of the streetscape. Therefore, if basement area is below grade and does not contribute to the apparent mass of a building, that area, even if it is habitable, need not be included in the total floor area.

* Basements (even habitable ones) do not count as floor area if first floor is no more than 3' above grade.

## Excavated features
* There are two types of excavated features:
* Light wells and stairwells
* Below-grade patios

FAR note (excavation)
* Excavation will not affect grade or measurement of floor area if standards are met (see pages 42 and 43).
