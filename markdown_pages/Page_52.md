## Table
* Columns: Structure | Max. height to roof peak

Figure 43
* Title: **Figure 43** Determining slope of roof
* Diagram labels: 12" run; 6" rise
* Text: Roof slope is the vertical rise in inches for every horizontal distance of twelve inches (called the “run”). It is expressed as rise:run or, in this example: 6:12.
* Note: Note: On a drawing this slope might also be represented as:
* First example shows “12” above a horizontal line with “6” below the line.
* Second example shows “2” above a horizontal line with “1” below the line.

Figure 42
* Title: **Figure 42** Comparison of roof slopes
* Caption above diagram: Height measured to top of roof material
* Left vertical marks: 33' (higher), 30' (lower)
* Roof slope labels on houses (left to right): 12:14, 12:12, 12:10, 12:6, 12:3
* Brackets beneath houses:
* Under the first two houses (12:14 and 12:12): Height limit = 33'
* Under the last three houses (12:10, 12:6, 12:3): Height limit = 30'
