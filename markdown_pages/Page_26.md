Title: Setbacks

Intro text:
Setbacks apportion a lot into two parts:
* buildable area (in the middle)
* required yards (surrounding the building area).
These required yards, meant to be maintained as open space areas, are important as landscaping opportunities to keep our neighborhoods attractive as well as for the preservation of privacy.
