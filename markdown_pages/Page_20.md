* Recessed porches on the 1st floor

Main rule block:
* Recessed porches on the ground floor do NOT count toward gross floor area if ALL the following criteria apply:
* Depth of porch is less than 10' and,
* Porch ceiling is below 2nd floor and,
* Exterior side is substantially open.

Note (boxed on right side):
* Note: It is the city's policy to consider one-story construction to be construction less than 17' above finished floor. If the porch space is higher, the area will count again as 2nd story equivalency.

Figure caption:
* **Figure 9** Recessed porches on the 1st floor

Left diagram (Example A) labels and caption:
* 2nd floor line
* Porch ceiling below 2nd floor
* Depth < 10'
* Caption: A This example complies with all three criteria and does NOT count toward gross floor area

Right diagram (Example B) labels and caption:
* 2nd floor line
* Height extends past 2nd floor line
* Depth > 10'
* Caption:
* B This example violates two of the three criteria:
* the porch depth is greater than 10' and
* the porch ceiling is above the 2nd floor
* Therefore it DOES count toward gross floor area and if it is higher than 17' it will count twice (see note).
