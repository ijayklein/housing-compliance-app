Title: Setback considerations

## Easements
Some easements affect setbacks i.e., setbacks must be measured from the edge of the easement regardless of the lot line as illustrated in **Figure 16** on this page. Easements that affect setbacks are:
* Creek easements
* Public street easements
Note: most public utility easements do not affect setbacks.

## Sidewalks
The sidewalk may not indicate the lot line. Often, the street easement or public right-of-way extends for several feet beyond the sidewalk. **Figure 16** on this page illustrates this common circumstance and how the setbacks are affected i.e., they must be measured from the lot line regardless of the sidewalk.

## Oddly shaped lots
For some lots, the setbacks and required yards may not be obvious. **Figure 17** on page 23 indicates the appropriate site plan for lot shapes about which questions often arise:
* flag lot (**Figure 17** A)
* corner lot (**Figure 17** B)
* through lot (**Figure 17** D)
* wedge-shaped lot (**Figure 17** E)
* lot with more than four sides (**Figure 17** F & G)

## Flag & substandard lots
**Figure 17** on page 23 also illustrates examples of setbacks that have been reduced for smaller or oddly shaped lots e.g.,
* the front setback of a flag lot (**Figure 17** A)
* the street-side yard setback for substandard corner lots that are less than 50' wide (**Figure 17** C)

Diagram labels:
* Rear yard
* Buildable area
* Front yard
* Interior-side yard (label appears on both side yards)
* Easement (hatched area). Caption text at easement: “Creek or public easement e.g., sewer or alley.”

Callouts on figure:
* “Setbacks are measured from easement regardless of where the lot lines are located. (See section on Lot Size for more information about creek easements).”
* “Setbacks are measured from the lot lines regardless of where the sidewalks are located. (Note: If the lot line is in the middle of the street, then the setback is measured from the edge of the public street easement or right-of-way. (See section on Lot Size for more information about public street easements).)”
* “Note: The space between the sidewalk edge and the lot line is part of the public right of way. It may be 0' or more than 15'. Please ask at the Development Center.”
