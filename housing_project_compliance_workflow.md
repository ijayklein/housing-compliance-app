## üèóÔ∏è **PHASE 1: PROJECT INITIATION & SITE ANALYSIS**

### **Step 1.1: Lot Qualification Assessment**

**üîç CRITICAL FIRST CHECK:**
- [ ] **Determine Zone District**: R-1, R-1(7000), R-1(8000), R-1(10000), or R-1(20000)
- [ ] **Verify Lot Dimensions Meet Minimums:**
  - Width: ‚â• 60 feet
  - Depth: ‚â• 100 feet
- [ ] **Confirm Lot Area Compliance:**
  - R-1: 6,000 - 9,999 sf
  - R-1(7000): 7,000 - 13,999 sf  
  - R-1(8000): 8,000 - 15,999 sf
  - R-1(10000): 10,000 - 19,999 sf
  - R-1(20000): 20,000 - 39,999 sf

**‚ùå STOP CONDITION:** If lot doesn't meet basic requirements, project cannot proceed without variance.

### **Step 1.2: Site Constraints Analysis**

**üìê Measure and Document:**
- [ ] **Gross vs Net Lot Area** - Account for easements, rights-of-way
- [ ] **Lot Shape** - Flag lots, oddly shaped lots have special setback rules
- [ ] **Existing Structures** - Document any existing buildings, encroachments
- [ ] **Utilities & Easements** - May affect setback measurements
- [ ] **Topography** - Slopes affect height calculations and daylight plane requirements

**üéØ Key Output:** Site survey with all constraints mapped

## üè† **PHASE 2: BUILDING DESIGN & COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION**

### **Step 2.1: Building Envelope Definition**

**üìè Setback Requirements (ALL MUST BE MET):**

#### **Front Setbacks:**
- [ ] **Standard Requirement:** Varies by zone (consult zoning table)
- [ ] **Contextual Front Setback:** May apply if neighborhood pattern exists
- [ ] **Garage Placement:** Special rules for garage setbacks from street

#### **Side Setbacks:**
- [ ] **Minimum Side Setback:** Typically 6-10 feet (zone dependent)
- [ ] **Combined Side Setbacks:** Total of both sides (zone dependent)
- [ ] **Corner Lot Rules:** Special requirements for corner properties

#### **Rear Setbacks:**
- [ ] **Standard Lots:** Typically 25 feet minimum
- [ ] **Back-to-Back Corner Lots:** May have different requirements
- [ ] **Encroachment Allowances:** Limited encroachments may be permitted

### **Step 2.2: Height & Massing Compliance**

**üìê Height Calculations:**
- [ ] **Maximum Building Height:** Typically 30 feet (verify for zone)
- [ ] **Measurement Method:** From average grade to highest point
- [ ] **Daylight Plane Compliance:** 45-degree plane from property lines
- [ ] **Roof Pitch Considerations:** Steeper pitches may allow height exemptions

**üèóÔ∏è Floor Area Calculations:**
- [ ] **Gross Floor Area (GFA) Limit:** Percentage of lot area (varies by zone)
- [ ] **Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Compliance:** Typically 45-50% of lot area
- [ ] **2nd & 3rd Floor Equivalencies:** Areas >17' and >26' count multiple times
- [ ] **Exclusions from GFA:** Basements, attics, certain architectural features

### **Step 2.3: Architectural Features Compliance**

**üèõÔ∏è Porches & Entry Features:**
- [ ] **Entry Feature Height:** ‚â§ 12 feet (standard), >12 feet = "vaulted"
- [ ] **Porch Coverage Rules:** Ground floor porches have specific GFA treatment
- [ ] **Bay Window Projections:** Limited projection into setbacks allowed
- [ ] **Fireplace Chimneys:** Special rules for chimney projections

**ü™ü Windows & Openings:**
- [ ] **Upper Floor Windows:** Privacy and setback considerations
- [ ] **Balcony & Deck Rules:** Upper level outdoor areas have GFA implications

## üöó **PHASE 3: PARKING & ACCESS DESIGN**

### **Step 3.1: Parking Requirements**

**üÖøÔ∏è Parking Space Standards:**
- [ ] **Minimum Parking Spaces:** Typically 2 spaces for single-family
- [ ] **Parking Space Dimensions:** Standard size requirements
- [ ] **Accessible Parking:** ADA compliance if required
- [ ] **Covered vs Uncovered:** Requirements may specify covered spaces

### **Step 3.2: Driveway & Access Design**

**üõ£Ô∏è Driveway Standards:**
- [ ] **Driveway Width:** Minimum and maximum width requirements
- [ ] **Driveway Length:** Sufficient space for vehicle maneuvering
- [ ] **Slope Requirements:** Maximum grade limitations
- [ ] **Setback from Property Lines:** Driveway placement rules

### **Step 3.3: Garage Design**

**üè† Garage Requirements:**
- [ ] **Garage Setbacks:** Different from main dwelling setbacks
- [ ] **Garage Door Orientation:** May need to face away from street
- [ ] **Contextual Garage Placement:** Neighborhood pattern considerations
- [ ] **Size Limitations:** Maximum garage size relative to dwelling

## üèóÔ∏è **PHASE 4: ACCESSORY STRUCTURES & SPECIAL FEATURES**

### **Step 4.1: Accessory Structures**

**üè† Secondary Buildings:**
- [ ] **Accessory Structure Setbacks:** Different rules than main dwelling
- [ ] **Maximum Size:** Size limits relative to main dwelling
- [ ] **Height Restrictions:** Lower height limits than main dwelling
- [ ] **Use Restrictions:** Cannot be used as primary residence

4. **Floor Area Ratio Violation:** GFA exceeds maximum allowed percentage
5. **Parking Deficiency:** Insufficient parking spaces or inadequate access
6. **Incompatible Design:** Doesn't meet architectural compatibility standards

### **‚ö†Ô∏è VARIANCE Required:**

- Setback reductions beyond allowed encroachments
- Height exceedances
- Parking space reductions
- Other deviations from code requirements

### **‚úÖ PROCEED Conditions:**

- All dimensional requirements met
- All setbacks compliant or within allowed encroachment limits
- Building height and massing within limits
- Floor area calculations within maximums
- Parking and access requirements satisfied
- All special features properly designed

2. **Setback Verification:** Minimum distances from all property lines
3. **Height Calculation:** Maximum height and daylight plane compliance
4. **Floor Area Calculation:** GFA percentage and equivalency calculations
5. **Parking Count:** Required vs provided parking verification

### **Manual Reviews:**
1. **Design Compatibility:** Architectural review for neighborhood fit
2. **Special Circumstances:** Flag lots, odd shapes, existing non-conformities
3. **Exception Applicability:** Determine if any rule exceptions apply
4. **Contextual Requirements:** Neighborhood pattern analysis

### **Professional Consultation Required:**
