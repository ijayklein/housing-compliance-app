A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 75' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.\n\nNote: Because this structure is 2 stories, it must be located within the buildable area regardless of the distances from the lot lines and is subject to Individual Review (IR)\n\nKey\n\u2014 Curb\n\u2014 Lot line\n\u2014 Sidewalk\n\u2014 Required setbacks\n\u2014 Buildable area\n\u2014 Dwelling/parking\n\u2014 Accessory structure",

Diagram A shows a combo garage/small pool cabana side by side in an interior lot example with a main dwelling, rear yard, front yard, and accessory structures marked. Diagram B shows a stand-alone pool cabana in an interior lot example with a larger pool cabana, main dwelling, 2-car attached garage, rear yard, and front yard. Diagram C shows an office above garage in a corner lot example with main dwelling, rear yard, front yard, and accessory structure labeled 'Office above garage'. Each diagram includes lot lines, required setbacks, buildable area, sidewalks, curbs, and accessory structures with a key explaining the symbols. Measurements such as 'Min. 75'' and '3' min.' are indicated for setbacks.",
