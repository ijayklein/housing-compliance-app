Front-half pattern lots\n\u2022 lots with garage in front half of the lot (F)\n\n2. Rear-half pattern lots\n\u2022 lots with garage in the rear half of the lot (B & D) and\n\u2022 lots with no garage (E) (counts as a rear-pattern lot)\n\nDetermine which pattern category is predominant i.e., into which category more than half of the lots fall.\n\nFront half\n\nRear half\n\nThe contextual-garage-placement regulation DOES apply.

It starts with excluding certain lot types (Flag lot C, Multi-family use G, Corner lots A & H), then dividing remaining lots into Front-half pattern lots (lots with garage in front half of lot F) and Rear-half pattern lots (lots with garage in rear half B & D and lots with no garage E). The flowchart ends with a decision box stating that if the rear half pattern is predominant, the contextual garage placement regulation applies and garages must be placed in the rear half of the lot.",
