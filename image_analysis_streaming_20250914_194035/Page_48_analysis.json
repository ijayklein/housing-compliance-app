The diagram shows a 'Buildable area' shaded in light gray, with a 'Main dwelling' shaded in darker gray. Various dimensions are marked including '3' max width' for light wells and stairwells, '3' min. from lot line (Typ.)', and '3' max. into side yard (Typ.)'. The diagram includes arrows and labels for dimensions a, b, c, and d representing different encroaching features. A key explains line types and shading: solid line for curb, dashed line for lot line, shaded blocks for sidewalk, dashed area for required setbacks, light gray for buildable area, dark gray for dwelling, and white for lightwells & stairwells that encroach into required yards.",
