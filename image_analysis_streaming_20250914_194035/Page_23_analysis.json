Each diagram shows a pitched roof with areas labeled 'A' and 'B'. Area A is shaded and marked as counting once as 1st floor, again as 2nd floor, and a third time as 3rd-floor equivalency. Area B is shaded differently and counts once as 1st floor and again as 2nd-floor equivalency. The diagrams include vertical measurements at 17' and 26' above the first floor, indicating the thresholds for counting floor equivalency. Labels indicate 'Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)', 'Vaulted ceiling space', 'Top of roof material (Typical)', and 'Top of finished floor (Typical)'. Horizontal arrows indicate widths of areas that count as 2nd-floor and 3rd-floor equivalency.",
