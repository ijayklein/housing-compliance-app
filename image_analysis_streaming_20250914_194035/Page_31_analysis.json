          "description": "Three adjacent lot diagrams illustrating allowable extensions of existing walls that encroach into required yards. Each lot is divided into rear yard, interior/side yard, and front yard areas. The first diagram (A) shows an extension of an existing side yard encroachment with a 5' minimum setback from the property line. The second diagram (B) shows an extension of an existing front yard encroachment with a 14' minimum setback and indicates the length of existing encroaching wall and half the width of the building max. The third diagram (C) shows an extension of an existing street-side yard encroachment with a 10' minimum setback. The diagrams use shading to differentiate existing house (light gray) and addition (black). Various dashed and solid lines indicate lot lines, required setbacks, buildable area, and sidewalks. Annotations specify minimum setback distances and extension limits.",
