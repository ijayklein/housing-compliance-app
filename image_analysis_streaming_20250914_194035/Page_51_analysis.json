Each diagram shows a lot layout with labeled areas including 'Rear yard', 'Front yard', 'Interior side yard', 'Main dwelling', 'Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max', and parking spaces. \n\n- Diagram A (far left) shows a 1-car detached garage for the 2nd dwelling and a 1-car attached garage for the main dwelling, with a 12' minimum buildable area between buildings and a 3' minimum setback from the interior side yard.\n- Diagram B (second from left) shows both the main and 2nd dwelling with 1-car attached garages, with similar 12' minimum buildable area and 3' minimum setback.\n- Diagram C (second from right) shows a 2-car detached garage shared by both dwellings, with the same 12' minimum buildable area and 3' minimum setback.\n- Diagram D (far right) shows a 2-car attached garage shared by both dwellings, with the 2nd dwelling unit and main dwelling adjacent, and the same 12' minimum buildable area.\n\nEach diagram uses shading and labels to distinguish buildable areas, dwellings, garages, and uncovered spaces. The diagrams are annotated with arrows and measurements indicating setbacks and buildable areas.",
