Diagram A shows a 2-car garage with rated walls at the rear yard with uncovered spaces in the driveway (tandem OK). Diagram B shows a 2-car carport with open sides at the rear yard with uncovered spaces in the driveway (tandem OK). Diagram C shows a 2-car garage with rated walls at the corner lot rear yard with uncovered spaces in the driveway (tandem OK). Each diagram includes measurements such as minimum 75' or midpoint for lots less than 95' deep, 3' minimum distance from lot lines for carports, 20' minimum from street-side lot line, and 10' from street-side yard for uncovered spaces. The diagrams also include annotations about compliance with Uniform Building Code (UBC) for fire-rated walls and roof materials, and the requirement for carports to be at least 3' from any lot line.",
