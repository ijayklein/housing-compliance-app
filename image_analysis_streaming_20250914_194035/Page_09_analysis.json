Development potential is based on the net lot area and while gross and net lot area are the same for most lots in Palo Alto, there are some lots for which portions must be excluded from the gross lot area to establish the net lot area.\n\nAreas excluded from the gross lot size are:\n\u2022 Street right-of-way (Area A of Fig 1 on this page)\n\u2022 \u201cPole\u201d portion of a flag lot (Area B of Fig 2 on this page)\n\u2022 Creek channel (Area C of Fig 3 on this page)\n\nFig 1 Gross lot area exclusions: street easements\n\nLot with boundaries that extend into the public ROW\n\nThe portion of the lot within the public ROW must be subtracted from the gross lot area.\n\nNote: In some areas of Palo Alto, like Barron Park, it is not unusual for the lot to extend to the middle of the street. However, for purposes, the lot is defined by the edge of the public street easement or public right-of-way (ROW). Dimensions for the public ROW are available at the Development Center\n\nPublic ROW\n\nFig 2 Gross lot area exclusions: flag-lot \u201cpoles\u201d\n\nFlag lot accessed via private easement\n\nFlag lot with \u201cpole\u201d\n\n\u201cpole\u201d portion of a lot must be subtracted from the gross lot size\n\nNote: Private access easements that provide access to lots are NOT subtracted from the lot on which they occur.\n\nStreet\n\nFig 3 Gross lot area exclusions: creek easements\n\nTop of bank\n\nLot with creek and/or creek easement\n\nThe portion of the lot within a creek channel must be subtracted from gross lot size.\n\nNote: The channel or area to be subtracted is defined by Santa Clara Valley Water District\u2019s easement or, if there is no easement, the top-of-bank.
