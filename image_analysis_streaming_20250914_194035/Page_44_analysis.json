Each diagram shows a lot with labeled areas: 'Buildable area' in light gray, 'Main dwelling' in medium gray, and attached garages in black labeled '1-car attached' or '2-car attached'. The diagrams include lot lines, sidewalks, curbs, required setbacks (dashed lines), no-parking areas (hatched lines), and uncovered spaces (depicted with a car icon). The first two diagrams (A and B) are interior lot examples with rear yards and front yards, while the third (C) is a corner lot example. A 10-foot measurement is shown on the street-side yard in the corner lot example. The diagrams visually differentiate between uncovered spaces located in the sideyard or driveway and no uncovered spaces.",
