The diagram shows a main dwelling and a 2nd dwelling with shaded areas representing buildable area and dwellings. It includes labeled encroachments: 'length of encroachment' on side and rear yards, '2' max. encroachment' on side yard, '4' max. encroachment' on rear yard, and '10' min. separation' between two encroaching features. Landscaping screening is indicated by tree icons. The diagram is annotated with yard labels: 'Front yard', 'Rear yard', 'Interior side yard'. A key explains symbols for curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, buildable area, dwelling, lightwells & stairwells, lightwells & stairwells that encroach into required yards, and landscaping screening.",
