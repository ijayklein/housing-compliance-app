Each example depicts a lot with a main dwelling, buildable area, and placement of equipment. Example A shows a combo garage/small poolhouse with pool equipment (P) and air conditioning (AC) in the rear yard with a 10' minimum clearance. Example B shows a larger poolhouse with pool equipment (P), air conditioning (AC), and a 2-car attached garage within the buildable area. Example C shows a garage with generator (G) and air conditioning (AC) in the street side yard with a 6' maximum encroachment. The diagram includes labels for rear yard, front yard, interior-side yard, street-side yard, and buildable area. A key explains symbols for curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, buildable area, dwelling/parking, and equipment types (P, AC, G).",
