It illustrates two vertical measurements labeled A and B from the top of the first floor down to the grade line. The basement and excavated feature areas are shaded differently. Labels indicate 'Basement' and 'Excavated feature'. The diagram explains that measurement A applies if excavation meets size/dimensional limits, and measurement B applies if excavated features exceed those limits. Additional notes clarify how grade is determined based on whether excavated features meet or exceed standards.",
