If yes, exclude certain lot types (Flag lot (C), Multi-family use with 3+ units (G), Corner lot facing cross street (H)). Then check if the number of remaining lots is 5 or more. If yes, exclude the smallest (D) and largest (E) setbacks. Finally, find the average of the remaining lots including the subject lot. If the average is greater than 30', the contextual setback applies. The example calculation shows 30 (A) + 33 (B) + 35 (F) = 98 \u00f7 3 = 32.7.",

Setbacks are indicated with measurements: 30' (A), 33' (B), 20' (D), 37' (E), 35' (F), and 'no' for G and H. The diagram includes lot lines, sidewalks, curbs, buildable areas (dashed), existing houses (solid black), and required setbacks (dashed lines).
