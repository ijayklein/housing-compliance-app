For example, to assure continuity in the appearance of the streetscape throughout our neighborhoods and city, the allowable building size is based on a percentage of the lot area. As Palo Alto developed and grew through annexation, each subdivision evolved with unique characteristics e.g., the size of the lots within the subdivision. Five R-1 zones reflect and preserve traditional lotting patterns with criteria for minimum and maximum lot sizes. Even within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes.
