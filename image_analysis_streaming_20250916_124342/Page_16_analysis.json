For the porch in Fig 5, the summary is as follows: Closed segments: A: 3', B: 8', C: 10', E: 14', Total: 35'. Open segments: D: 7', F: 24', G: 4', Total: 35'. Conclusion: The perimeter of the porch in Fig 5 is 50% open and so the porch would NOT count toward gross floor area. Note: If a porch floor is more than 30\\\" above grade, the porch sides may need to be 36\\\" high for safety reasons. This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right: \u2022 Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls. \u2022 A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.\",\n  \"figures\": [\n    \"Fig 5: Architectural diagram showing porch layout with labeled segments A through G and their measurements\",\n    \"Diagram showin",
