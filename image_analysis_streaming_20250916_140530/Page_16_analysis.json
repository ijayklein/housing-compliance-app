This may cause the porch facade to be considered closed. Possible solutions to make sure the porch sides are considered open are illustrated to the right:\n  \u2022 Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls.\n  \u2022 A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.\n\nRight-side detail labels\n- Safety rail\n- Porch flr\n- Grade\n- 36\"\n- 30\"\n- Both illustrations labeled: Open\n\nPage number\n- 10",
