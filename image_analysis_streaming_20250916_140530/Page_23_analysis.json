Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured.\n\nExamples statement\n- In the examples of Fig 12 below the highlighted areas count as follows:\n\nArea A\n- once as 1st floor,\n- again as 2nd floor, and\n- a third time as 3rd floor equivalency\n\nArea B\n- once as 1st floor,\n- again as 2nd floor equivalency\n\nNote (verbatim)\n- 200 sf of 3rd floor equivalency may be exempted where roof pitch is 4:12 or steeper (see \u201cHeight\u201d section).\n\nFigure caption\n- Fig 12 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\n\nFigure callouts and labels visible in both building sections\n- 26'\n- 17'\n- Top of roof material (Typical)\n- Top of finished floor (Typical)\n- 1st flr (left figure label at first floor)\n- 1st fl (right figure label at first floor)\n- Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\n- Vaulted ceiling space (appears over Area B in right figure)\n- A (shaded area label)\n- B (shaded area label)\n- Width of area that counts as 3rd floor equivalency\n- Width of area that counts as 2nd floor equivalency\n- Width of area that counts as 2nd floor (baseline width noted along the first level)\n\nPage number\n- 17",
