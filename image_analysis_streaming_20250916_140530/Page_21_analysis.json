This may be illustrated by comparing Roof Plans 1 & 2 of Fig 10.\n\n- Figure label under perspective drawing: Fig 10 Balconies\n  - Labels with arrows on the drawing: Roof plan 1; Roof plan 2\n\n- Roof Plan 1:\n  - Area A: Counts because it is roofed\n  - Area B: Does not count because this arbor is substantially open\n  - Area C: Does not count because the overhang is the same size as the overhang around the rest of the house and is considered to be open\n  - Dimensional labels on plan: Width of overhang over the balcony; Width of overhang around the rest of the house\n\n- Roof Plan 2:\n  - Area A: Counts because it is roofed\n  - Area B: Counts because the overhang here is greater than the overhang around the rest of the house, and considered to be roofed\n  - Area C: Does not count because it is open\n  - Dimensional labels on plan: Width of overhang over the balcony; Width of overhang around the rest of the house\n\n- Note: Pop-out balconies are subject to the same evaluation.\n\n- Page number: 15",
