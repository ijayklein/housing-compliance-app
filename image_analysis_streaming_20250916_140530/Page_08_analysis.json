Five R-1 zones reflect and preserve traditional lotting patterns with criteria for minimum and maximum lot sizes.\n\nMin. & max. lot sizes by zone\n- The subdivision ordinance requires a new lot to have:\n  A) width \u2265 60' AND depth \u2265 100' AND\n  B) lot area (in sf) per the following:\n  - Zone District R-1: Minimum 6,000; Maximum 9,999\n  - Zone District R-1(7000): Minimum 7,000; Maximum 13,999\n  - Zone District R-1(8000): Minimum 8,000; Maximum 15,999\n  - Zone District R-1(10000): Minimum 10,000; Maximum 19,999\n  - Zone District R-1(20000): Minimum 20,000; Maximum 39,999\n\nExceptions to the max. lot size\n- Where underlying lot lines must be removed to eliminate non-conformities and results in no net loss of housing.\n- Where an adjacent substandard lot of less than 25' in width is combined with another lot and results in no net loss of housing.\n- Where the resultant number of lots increases or stays the same and results in no net loss of housing.\n\nSection: Substandard lots\n- Even within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes. Smaller lots that meet the following criteria are considered to be substandard.\n\nSubstandard lot sizes by zone\n- A substandard lot is one with:\n  A) width < 50' OR depth < 83' AND\n  B) area \u2264 the following (83% of min. lot size):\n  - Zone District R-1: Typical lot 4,980; Flag lot 5,976\n  - Zone District R-1(7000): Typical lot 5,810; Flag lot 6,972\n  - Zone District R-1(8000): Typical lot 6,640; Flag lot 7,968\n  - Zone District R-1(10000): Typical lot 8,300; Flag lot 9,960\n  - Zone District R-1(20000): Typical lot 16,600; Flag lot 19,920\n\nSpecial regulations for substandard lots\n- Maximum building height is single-story and 17' instead of 30'.\n- For lots less than 50' wide, the required street-side yard is 10' instead of 16'. (Fig 15 C on p. 23)\n- For lots less than 95' deep, the requirements for locating a garage in the rear or side yards are that it be in the rear half of the lot instead of 75' back from the front lot line.\n\nNote: Determining where lot lines are on the ground may require a boundary survey.",
