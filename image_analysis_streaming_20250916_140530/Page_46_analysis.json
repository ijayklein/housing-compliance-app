Therefore, if basement area is below grade and does not contribute to the apparent mass of a building, that area, even if it is habitable, need not be included in the total floor area.\n\nCode sections\n- Page 40 \u2014 18.12.090 (a, b, & c)\n- Page 41 \u2014 18.12.090 (c)\n- Page 43 \u2014 18.12.090 (c) (1)\n- Page 44 \u2014 18.12.090 (c) (2)\n\nBasement standards (bulleted list)\n- May not be located in special flood hazard areas.\n- May not extend beyond building footprint.\n- May not encroach into required yards, except where main dwelling is permitted to extend into rear yard.\n\nFAR note (basements)\n- Basements (even habitable ones) do not count as floor area if first floor is no more than 3' above grade.\n\nExcavated features\n- There are two types of excavated features:\n  - Light wells and stairwells\n  - Below-grade patios\n\nFAR note (excavation)\n- Excavation will not affect grade or measurement of floor area if standards are met (see pages 42 and 43).\n\nFigure captions and on-figure labels\n- Fig 35 Basement & grade\n- Fig 36 Excavated feature & grade\n  - A: distance between top of first floor and grade if excavation meets the size/dimensional limits described in Figs 39\u201340 on pp. 42\u201343.\n  - B: distance between top of first floor and grade if excavated features exceed the size/dimensional limits described in Figs 39\u201340 on pp. 42\u201343.\n  - Top of first floor\n  - Basement\n  - Excavated feature\n  - Grade if excavated features meet standards described in Figs 39\u201340 on pp. 42\u201343.\n  - Grade if excavated features exceed standards described in Figs 39\u201340 on pp. 42\u201343.\n\nObserved page number\n- 40",
