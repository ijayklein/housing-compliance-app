Development potential is based on the net lot area and while gross and net lot area are the same for most lots in Palo Alto, there are some lots for which portions must be excluded from the gross lot area to establish the net lot area.\n\nAreas excluded from the gross lot size are:\n- Street right-of-way (Area A of Fig 1 on this page)\n- \u201cPole\u201d portion of a flag lot (Area B of Fig 2 on this page)\n- Creek channel (Area C of Fig 3 on this page)\n\nFig 1 Gross lot area exclusions: street easements\n- Labels/text shown in the figure:\n  - Lot with boundaries that extend into the public ROW\n  - The portion of the lot within the public ROW must be subtracted from the gross lot area.\n  - Notes In some areas of Palo Alto, like Barron Park, it is not unusual for the lot to extend to the middle of the street. However for lot area purposes, the lot is defined by the edge of the public street easement or public right-of-way (ROW). Dimensions for the public ROW are available at the Development Center\n  - Public ROW\n  - A\n  - SS\n\nFig 2 Gross lot area exclusions: flag-lot \u201cpoles\u201d\n- Labels/text shown in the figure:\n  - Flag lot accessed via private easement\n  - Flag lot with \u201cpole\u201d\n  - \u201cpole\u201d portion of a lot must be subtracted from the gross lot size\n  - x: Private access easements that provide access to lots are NOT subtracted from the lot on which they occur.\n  - B\n  - Street\n\nFig 3 Gross lot area exclusions: creek easements\n- Labels/text shown in the figure:\n  - Creek easement\n  - The portion of the lot within a creek channel must be subtracted from gross lot size.\n  - Note: The channel or area to be subtracted is defined by Santa Clara Valley Water District\u2019s easement or, if there is no easement, the top-of-bank.
