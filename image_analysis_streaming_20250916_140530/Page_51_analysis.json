(Because it is detached and at least 75' from the front lot line, it may be located in the rear and side yards.)\n- Both dwellings use driveway for their uncovered spaces (beyond front setback)\nDiagram labels visible in this panel\n- Interior lot example\n- Rear yard\n- Front yard\n- Main dwelling\n- Detached 2nd dwelling unit 900 sf max\n- 1-car detached (small garage symbol at rear; additional small text appears to read \u201c200 sf max\u201d but the \u201c200\u201d is faint)\n- 1-car attached (at the main dwelling)\n- Buildable area\n- A vertical dimension arrow in the rear yard labeled \u201c\u2014' min.\u201d The number is not fully legible in the scan.\n\nScenario B\nHeading\n- B Attached & separate from main-dwelling parking\nBulleted text\n- Main dwelling has 1-car attached garage.\n- 2nd dwelling has a 1-car attached garage.
