If the porch space is higher, the area will count again as 2nd story equivalency.\n\nFigure caption:\n- Fig 9 Recessed porches on the 1st floor\n\nLeft diagram (Example A) labels and caption:\n- 2nd floor line\n- Porch ceiling below 2nd floor\n- Depth < 10'\n- Caption: A This example complies with all three criteria and does NOT count toward gross floor area\n\nRight diagram (Example B) labels and caption:\n- 2nd floor line\n- Height extends past 2nd floor line\n- Depth > 10'\n- Caption:\n  - B This example violates two of the three criteria:\n    - the porch depth is greater than 10' and\n    - the porch ceiling is above the 2nd floor\n  - Therefore it DOES count toward gross floor area and if it is higher than 17' it will count twice (see note).\n\nPage number:\n- 14",
