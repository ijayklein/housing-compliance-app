Roofed porches on the 1st floor 3. Roofed entry features on the 1st floor that are less than 12' high (from grade) 4. Roofed entry features on the 1st floor that are more than 12' high from grade\u2014'vaulted entry feature' 5. Recessed porches on the 1st floor 6. Roofed balconies/setback areas on upper floors. Facades with defined entryways make a streetscape pleasant and friendly as long as they are not out of scale or proportion. The gross floor area regulations encourage appropriately sized porches and entryways. A feature is considered to be a porch rather than an entry feature if it can clearly accommodate more activities than entering and leaving the house.",
