    "content": "Some easements affect setbacks i.e., setbacks must be measured from the edge of the easement regardless of the lot line as illustrated in Fig 16 on this page. Easements that affect setbacks are: Creek easements, Public street easements. Note: most public utility easements do not affect setbacks. The sidewalk may not indicate the lot line. Often, the street easement or public right-of-way extends for several feet beyond the sidewalk. Fig 16 on this page illustrates this common circumstance and how the setbacks are affected i.e., they must be measured from the lot line regardless of the sidewalk. For some lots, the setbacks and required yards may not be obvious. Fig 17 on page 23 indicates the appropriate site plan for lot shapes about which questions often arise: flag lot (Fig 17 A), corner lot (Fig 17 B), through lot (Fig 17 D), wedge-shaped lot (Fig 17 E), lot with more than four sides (Fig 17 F & G). Fig 17 on page 23 also illustrates examples of setbacks that have been reduced for smaller or oddly shaped lots e.g., the front setback of a flag lot (Fig 17 A), the street-side yard setback for substandard corner lots that are less than 50' wide (Fig 17 C)",
