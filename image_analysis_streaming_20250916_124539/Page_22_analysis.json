Voluminous spaces in a structure contribute to the mass even if these areas are not used or described in the floor plan. The 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency addresses how these areas count toward the gross floor area. Area A of this 3rd floor (accessible via stairs), has 5' of head clearance and counts as 3rd floor area. Area B of this 2nd floor (accessible via stairs), has 5' of head clearance and is included in the count of the, more obvious, 2nd floor area.",
