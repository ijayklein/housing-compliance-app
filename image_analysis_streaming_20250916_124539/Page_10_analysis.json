Lot coverage describes how much of the lot is covered by structures but doesn't evaluate the mass of those structures. Gross floor area describes the mass of the structures by reflecting the cumulative square footage of all visible levels. Maximum allowable lot coverage is expressed by a ratio\u201435% of the lot size. Maximum allowable gross floor area is expressed by a ratio\u2014the sum of 45% of the first 5,000 sf of lot area plus 30% of any portion of lot area in excess of 5,000 sf.",
