Design criteria for bay windows that do not count: Bottom of feature must be at least 18\" above the floor joists, Exterior supports must be features like corbels and/or brackets rather than solid walls, At least 50% of the surface is glass. Architectural relief features such as bay windows are pleasant additions to a house design and are encouraged. If they meet certain design criteria they do not count toward gross floor area.",
