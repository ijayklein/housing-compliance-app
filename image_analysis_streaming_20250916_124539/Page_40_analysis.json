    "content": "Parking regulations affect the appearance of the streetscapes in our residential neighborhoods by minimizing the number of cars parked on the street and in the front yards by requiring that there are parking spaces available deeper into the lot. Two spaces are required on the lot (per dwelling). They may NOT be located in the required front yard or, first 10 ft of, required street side yard. 2nd dwelling units have same requirements. No underground parking garages except by variance. One of the two spaces must be covered. To be considered detached, a covered-parking structure must be a minimum of 3' from the main dwelling. Minimum size for an uncovered space is 8.5' x 18'. Minimum clearance inside a covered parking structure to be 10' x 20' for each space. Therefore, a two-car garage or carport to be 20' x 20' clear inside. Minimum vertical clearance: 7'. Clear area for parking space must be free of other uses e.g., water heaters, clothes washers or dryer, bicycle parking facilities, etc.",
