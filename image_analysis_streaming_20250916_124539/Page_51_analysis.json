Both dwellings use driveway for their uncovered spaces (beyond front setback). B: Attached & separate from main-dwelling parking. Main dwelling has 1-car attached garage. 2nd dwelling has a 1-car attached garage (Because attached, it must be located within the building area rather than in the rear or side yards.) Both dwellings use driveway for their uncovered spaces (beyond front setback). C: Detached & combined with main-dwelling parking. Both dwellings share a 2-car detached garage. Both dwellings use the driveway for their respective uncovered spaces (beyond front setback). D: Combined w/ main-dwelling parking that is attached to main dwelling. Both dwellings share a 2-car attached garage. Both dwellings use the driveway for their respective uncovered spaces (beyond front setback).",
