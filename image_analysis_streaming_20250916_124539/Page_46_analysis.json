Therefore, if basement area is below grade and does not contribute to the apparent mass of a building, that area, even if it is habitable, need not be included in the total floor area. May not be located in special flood hazard areas. May not extend beyond building footprint. May not encroach into required yards, except where main dwelling is permitted to extend into rear yard. There are two types of excavated features: Light wells and stairwells, Below-grade patios",
