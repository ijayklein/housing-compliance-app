Note: If the entryway is considered to be a vaulted entryway the area will be counted as follows: In this example, a portion of the entryway is recessed beyond the house facade and roof. It is included in the area that counts. The area is measured to the outside material of the entryway feature. The area counts TWICE toward gross floor area.",
