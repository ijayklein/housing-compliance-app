This may cause the porch facade\nto be considered closed. Possible solutions to make\nsure the porch sides are considered open are\nillustrated to the right:\n\u2022 Railings (ballisters) instead of solid half walls.\n\u2022 A single safety rail above lower, solid half walls.\n\nOpen\n\nOpen\n\nSafety rail\nPorch flr\nGrade\n\n10",
