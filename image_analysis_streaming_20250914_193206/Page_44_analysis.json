Each example shows a lot line, rear yard, buildable area, main dwelling, front yard, interior-side yards, and parking structures. Example A is an interior lot with a 1-car attached garage and an uncovered second space in the sideyard. Example B is an interior lot with a 1-car attached garage and an uncovered second space in the driveway. Example C is a corner lot with a 2-car attached garage and no uncovered spaces. The diagram includes a key explaining various elements like curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, buildable area, dwelling, parking structure, no-parking area, and uncovered space.",
