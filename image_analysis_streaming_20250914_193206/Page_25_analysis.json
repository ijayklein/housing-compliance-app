There are three chimneys depicted: one on the upper floor, one on the ground floor, and another on the ground floor. The shed-like structure is separate from the house. Arrows and text labels point to specific elements: 'Chimneys on the upper floors DO NOT COUNT' points to the upper chimney. 'Height' is labeled next to the shed. A dashed line indicates the ground level. Callouts explain how different elements are counted towards gross floor area or FAR.",
