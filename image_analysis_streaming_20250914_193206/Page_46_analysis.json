The ground is represented by a hatched pattern. A vertical line labeled 'Basement' extends downwards from the building's foundation. Adjacent to it, another vertical line labeled 'Excavated feature' extends downwards, indicating an excavation. There are two arrows labeled 'A' and 'B' indicating vertical distances. 'A' points from the 'Top of first floor' to the 'Grade' line where excavated features meet standards. 'B' points from the 'Top of first floor' to a lower 'Grade' line where excavated features exceed standards. The diagram visually explains the definitions of 'A' and 'B' in relation to the top of the first floor and different grade levels for excavated features.",
