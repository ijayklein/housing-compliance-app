Each diagram shows a portion of a building wall with a bay window structure. Diagram A shows a bay window that does not count, with its bottom at least 18 inches above the floor joists and supported by corbels. Diagram B shows a bay window that counts because the floor joists extend into it. Diagrams C & D show bay windows that count due to an exterior skirt wall (one angled, one straight). Diagram E shows a bay window that counts because less than 50% of its surface is glass. A vertical dimension line indicates '18\" min. from top of floor to bottom of baywindow structure' for diagram A. A horizontal dimension line indicates '2' max. from bay window surface to facade surface (Typical all)' for the projection of the bay window from the main wall.",
