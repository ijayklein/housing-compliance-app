          "description": "A flowchart illustrating the process to determine if a contextual setback applies. It starts with a question 'Does block have more than 3 lots? (incl project lot)'. If 'Yes', it leads to 'Exclude the following types of lots: Flag lot (C), Multi-family use w/ 3+ units (G), Corner lot facing cross street (H)'. Then it asks 'Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?'. If 'Yes', it leads to 'Exclude the smallest and largest setbacks: Smallest (D), Largest (E)'. Finally, it instructs to 'Find the average of the remaining lots (incl. subject lot). If greater than 30', it applies.' A calculation box shows '30 (A) + 33 (B) + 35 (F) = 98 \u00f7 3 = 32.7'. A 'Note' box is also present: 'If block is more than 600' long, consider only lots within 600' (max. 10 lots).'",
