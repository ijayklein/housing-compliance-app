Key areas are labeled 'A' (in the attic) and 'B' (on the second floor, under a sloped roof section). A vertical measurement of 5' is indicated for head clearance. Stairs are shown leading to the second floor and potentially to the attic. The ground floor is labeled '1st floor'. There are also labels 'CC' and 'oor' which appear to be part of the diagram's internal labeling or possibly truncated text. Arrows point from the top of the floor to the underside of the rafter, illustrating the measurement method.",
