It shows a main dwelling and a second dwelling within a lot defined by a lot line and required setbacks. Various elements are labeled: 'Interior-side yard' on both sides, 'Front yard' at the bottom, and 'Rear yard' at the top. There are two below-grade patio features, one associated with the main dwelling and one with the second dwelling. The patio associated with the main dwelling shows a 'length of encroachment' labeled 'a' with a '2' max. encroachment' into the interior-side yard, and a '10' min. separation' from the second dwelling. The patio associated with the second dwelling shows a 'length of encroachment' labeled 'b' with a '4' max. encroachment' into the rear yard. Both patios are depicted with landscaping screening. The diagram also includes a key.",
