Each solution shows a main dwelling, various yards (front, rear, interior-side, street-side), and the placement of equipment like pool equipment (P), air conditioning units (AC), and generators (G). The diagrams include elements like curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, and buildable area. Specific measurements like '10' min. clear' for driveway clearance and '6' max.' for AC unit setback are shown.",
