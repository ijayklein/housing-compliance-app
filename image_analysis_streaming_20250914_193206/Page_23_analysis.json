The diagram is labeled 'Fig 12 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency'. It shows a '1st flr' (first floor) and a second floor. The attic space is labeled 'Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)'. Vertical measurements of 17' and 26' are indicated from the 'Top of finished floor (Typical)' to the 'Top of roof material (Typical)'. Two highlighted areas, 'A' and 'B', are shown with hatched patterns. Area A spans from the first floor up through the second floor and into the attic. Area B is a stairwell area extending from the first floor to the second floor. Text labels indicate 'Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency' and 'Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency' for portions of the attic space.",
