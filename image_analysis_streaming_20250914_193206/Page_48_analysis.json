The figure shows a top-down view of an 'Interior lot example' with a 'Rear yard' at the top and 'Front yard' at the bottom. The lot is bounded by 'Interior-side yard' on both left and right sides. Inside the lot, there's a 'Buildable area' (light grey dashed line rectangle) and a 'Main dwelling' (darker grey rectangle). Several light wells and stairwells are depicted as black and white rectangles encroaching into the side and front yards. Dimensions 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are indicated for various light well/stairwell features. There are also measurements for '3' max. width' for a feature, '3' min. from lot line (Typ.)', and '3' max. into side yard (Typ.)'.",
