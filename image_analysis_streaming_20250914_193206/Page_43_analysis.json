          "description": "A flowchart illustrating the process of determining contextual garage placement. It starts with 'Exclude the following types of lots' and 'The remaining lots including the subject lot, contribute to the determination.' leading to 'Divide the remaining lots, including the subject lot, into two categories: 1. Front-half pattern lots' and '2. Rear-half pattern lots'. These then lead to 'Determine which pattern category is predominant i.e., into which category more than half of the lots fall.' which branches into 'Front half' and 'Rear half'. The 'Rear half' path leads to a box stating 'The contextual-garage-placement regulation DOES apply. Projects on this block must place the garage in the rear half of the lot.'",
