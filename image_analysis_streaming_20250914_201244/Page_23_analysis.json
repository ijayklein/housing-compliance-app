Both diagrams show a pitched roof with labeled height markers at 17' and 26' above the first floor. Shaded areas labeled 'A' and 'B' indicate zones counted as 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor equivalency. The diagrams highlight 'Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)' areas and stairwells. Arrows and dimension lines indicate widths of areas that count as 2nd-floor and 3rd-floor equivalency. The right diagram additionally labels a 'Vaulted ceiling space' within area B. Roof material and finished floor levels are marked as typical.",
