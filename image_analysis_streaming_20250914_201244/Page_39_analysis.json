Each diagram depicts a lot with a main dwelling, buildable area, yards (rear, front, interior-side, street-side), and placement of equipment:\n\n- Diagram A (Pool equipment): Shows a combo garage/small poolhouse in the rear yard, pool equipment (P) within the buildable area behind the garage/poolhouse, and air conditioning equipment (AC) in an out-of-the-way niche with a 10' minimum clearance from the driveway.\n\n- Diagram B (Pool equipment & AC unit): Shows a larger poolhouse in the rear yard, pool equipment (P) within the buildable area next to the poolhouse, air conditioning equipment (AC) located within the buildable area behind the house, and a 2-car attached garage.\n\n- Diagram C (Generator & AC unit): Shows a garage in the buildable area, air conditioning equipment (AC) located in the street side yard with a maximum 6' encroachment, and a generator (G) located within the buildable area.\n\nA key explains symbols used: solid line for curb, dashed line for lot line, shaded rectangles for sidewalk, dashed rectangles for required setbacks, shaded area for buildable area, darker shaded for dwelling/parking. Equipment symbols: P = Pool equip., AC = Air conditioning equip., G = Generator.",
