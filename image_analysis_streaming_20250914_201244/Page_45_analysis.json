Each example depicts a lot layout with a main dwelling, buildable area, front yard, rear yard, and interior side yards. Example A shows a 2-car garage with rated walls located at the rear yard lot line with uncovered spaces in the driveway (tandem parking allowed). Example B shows a 2-car carport with open sides set at least 3 feet from any lot line, also with uncovered spaces in the driveway (tandem parking allowed). Example C shows a 2-car garage with rated walls located at the corner lot rear yard with uncovered spaces in the driveway (tandem parking allowed). The figure includes measurements such as minimum 75 feet or midpoint for lots less than 95 feet deep, minimum 20 feet from the street-side lot line, and minimum 10 feet for uncovered spaces from the street-side yard. The figure also includes a key explaining symbols for curb, lot line, sidewalk, required setbacks, buildable area, dwelling, parking structure, no-parking area, and uncovered space.",
