A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 75' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.\n\nNote: Because this structure is 2 stories, it must be located within the buildable area regardless of the distances from the lot lines and is subject to Individual Review (IR)\n\nInterior lot example\n\nRear yard\n\nCombo garage / small poo house\n\nMain dwelling\n\nMin. 75'\n\nInterior lot example\n\nRear yard\n\nLarger pool cabana\n\nMain dwelling\n\n2-car attached garage\n\nMin. 75'\n\nCorner lot example\n\nRear yard\n\nOffice above garage\n\nMain dwelling\n\n3' min.\n\nKey\n\nCurb\nLot line\nSidewalk\nRequired setbacks\nBuildable area\nDwelling/parking\nAccessory structure\n\n31",

Each example includes a site plan diagram illustrating the location of the accessory structure relative to the main dwelling, lot lines, yards (rear, front, interior side, street side), and required setbacks. The diagrams use shading and labels to differentiate between the main dwelling, accessory structures, buildable area, required setbacks, sidewalks, lot lines, and curbs. Dimensions such as 'Min. 75'' from front lot line and '3' min.' setback are indicated with arrows. The diagrams also show plumbing fixture counts and fire rating requirements for walls and roofs where applicable.",
