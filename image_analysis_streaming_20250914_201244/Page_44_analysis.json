Each example depicts a lot layout with labeled areas such as 'Rear yard', 'Front yard', 'Street-side yard', 'Buildable area', and 'Main dwelling'. The figure includes three lot types: two 'Interior lot examples' and one 'Corner lot example'.\n\n- Example A: Shows a 1-car garage attached to the main dwelling with a second uncovered parking space located in the sideyard. The garage is adjacent to the sidewalk with a 1-foot distance from the sidewalk.\n- Example B: Shows a 1-car garage attached to the main dwelling with a second uncovered parking space located in the driveway.\n- Example C: Shows a 2-car garage attached to the main dwelling with no uncovered spaces.\n\nThe figure uses a key to denote various elements: solid lines for curb and lot line, a patterned area for sidewalk, dashed lines for required setbacks, a dashed box for buildable area, solid grey for dwelling, solid black for parking structure, diagonal lines for no-parking area, and a car icon for uncovered space. A 10-foot measurement is shown indicating the required distance for uncovered spaces from the street-side yard.\n\nThe figure is positioned at the bottom half of the page.",
