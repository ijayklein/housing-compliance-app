It starts with excluding certain lot types (Flag lot C, Multi-family use of 3+ units G, Corner lots A & H), then dividing remaining lots into Front-half pattern lots (lots with garage in front half of lot F) and Rear-half pattern lots (lots with garage in rear half B & D and lots with no garage E, counted as rear-pattern lot). The diagram shows arrows leading to 'Front half' and 'Rear half' boxes, and a concluding box stating that if rear half is predominant, the contextual garage placement regulation applies and garages must be placed in the rear half of the lot.",
