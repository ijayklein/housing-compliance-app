Each diagram is labeled as A, B, or C corresponding to side yard, front yard, and street-side yard encroachments respectively. Each shows a lot with rear yard, front yard, and interior or street-side yard labeled. Existing houses are shaded in gray, additions in black. Setbacks are marked with dashed lines and minimum distances (5', 14', 10') are indicated with arrows. Notes on extension limits and maximum lengths are annotated. A key explains line types and shading.",
