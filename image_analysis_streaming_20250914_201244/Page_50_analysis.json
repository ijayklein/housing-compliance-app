(see table)\n\u2022 Maximum size is 450 sf (basement area counts towards the size of the 2nd-dwelling unit even if it does not count toward total gross floor area.)\n\u2022 Maximum height is 17'.\n\u2022 Must have two parking spaces (one to be covered).\n\u2022 Maximum size for covered parking is 200 sf.
