The drawing includes two dormer protrusions on the roof, each with a maximum width of 7.5 feet, separated by a minimum of 5 feet. Vertical height limits and angles are marked, including a 60\u00b0 angle from the rear setback line, a 16-foot vertical measurement, and a 24-foot maximum height for protrusions. The maximum building height is indicated with a dashed vertical line. The drawing also shows the setback line, rear yard, and rear lot line.
