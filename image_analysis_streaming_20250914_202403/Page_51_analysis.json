The figure consists of four distinct site plans (A, B, C, D) arranged horizontally, each illustrating a different parking and dwelling configuration on an 'Interior lot example'. Each plan shows a 'Main dwelling' and a 'Detached 2nd dwelling unit' (900 sf max), along with associated parking (1-car attached, 1-car detached, or 2-car detached/attached). Key elements like 'Front yard', 'Rear yard', 'Interior-side yard', 'Buildable area', 'Required setbacks', 'Curb', 'Lot line', and 'Sidewalk' are depicted. Cars are shown in parking spaces. The 'Buildable area' is light grey, 'Dwelling' is medium grey, '2nd-dwelling unit & associated pkg' is dark grey, and 'Uncovered space' is white with car icons. 'Area that may not be used to satisfy required parking spaces' is indicated by diagonal hatching.",
