The diagram shows various setback lines, height restrictions, and protrusion limits. A dashed line representing the daylight plane originates from the rear setback line at a 60-degree angle. Dimensions for maximum protrusion length (7.5' each), minimum separation between protrusions (5'), maximum height for protrusions (24'), and a general maximum building height are indicated. The ground is depicted with hatching, and a 'Rear yard' area is labeled between the 'Setback line' and 'Rear lot line'.",
