          "description": "Figure 13: Bay windows. This figure illustrates five different bay window configurations (labeled A through E) and indicates whether they count towards gross floor area based on specific design criteria. Each illustration shows a cross-section of a bay window attached to a building facade. \n- Illustration A: Shows a bay window with its bottom at least 18 inches above the floor joists and supported by corbels. It has a dimension line indicating '2' max. from bay window surface to facade surface (Typical all)' and another indicating '18\" min. from top of floor to bottom of baywindow structure'. This configuration 'Does NOT count'.\n- Illustration B: Shows a bay window where the floor joists extend into the bay window structure. This configuration 'Counts because floor joists continue into the bay window'.\n- Illustration C & D: Shows two bay windows, one with an angled exterior skirt wall and another with a straight exterior skirt wall. Both are labeled together as 'C & D' and 'Count because of exterior skirt wall (angled or straight)'.\n- Illustration E: Shows a bay window where the glass surface appears to be less than 50% of the total surface area. This configuration 'Counts because the surface is not at least 50% glass'.",
