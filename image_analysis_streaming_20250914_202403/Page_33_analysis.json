Both properties have 'Front yard', 'Rear yard', and 'Interior-side yard' areas. The 'Subject House' property also shows a 'Buildable area'. Dashed lines indicate 'Required setbacks' and 'Lot line'. Arrows and text indicate how the average grade is calculated for each side of the structure, specifically as the average of grades at two points along the interior-side yard. The diagram illustrates the concept of 'Buildable area' within the lot boundaries and setbacks.",
