          "description": "A cross-sectional diagram of a building showing two different attic/upper floor configurations (labeled A and B) and how different areas are measured for 2nd and 3rd floor equivalency. The diagram on the left shows a building with a 1st floor, a 2nd floor, and an attic space. The attic space is divided into two sections, 'A' and 'B'. Section 'A' is an 'Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)' area, and section 'B' is a 'Vaulted ceiling space' with a staircase leading up to it. The diagram indicates measurements for 'Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency' and 'Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency' within the attic/upper floor. It also shows height references: 'Top of roof material (Typical)' at 26' and 17' above the 'Top of finished floor (Typical)' which is labeled '1st flr'. The diagram on the right is similar but shows a slightly different roofline and internal structure, also indicating 'Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)' and 'Vaulted ceiling space' with corresponding width measurements for 2nd and 3rd floor equivalency, and height references at 26' and 17' above the '1st fl'. Both diagrams show hatched areas representing the counted floor equivalencies.",
