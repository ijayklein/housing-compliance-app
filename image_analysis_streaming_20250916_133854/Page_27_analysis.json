(incl project lot)\n*   **Note:** If block is more than 600' long, consider only lots within 600' (max. 10 lots).\n\n**Step 2 (If \"Yes\" to Step 1):**\n*   **Action:** Exclude the following types of lots:\n    *   Flag lot (C)\n    *   Multi-family use w/ 3+ units (G)\n    *   Corner lot facing cross street (H)\n*   **Question:** Is the number of remaining lots more or less than 5 or more?\n\n**Step 3 (If \"Yes\" to Step 2):**\n*   **Action:** Exclude the smallest and largest setbacks:\n    *   Smallest (D)\n    *   Largest (E)\n*   **Action:** Find the average of the remaining lots (incl. subject lot). If greater than 30', it applies.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n*   30 (A)\n*   33 (B)\n*   + 35 (F)\n*   98 \u00f7 3 = 32.7\n\n**Fig 15 Example of a block with a contextual setback of 32.7'**\n\n**Diagram Elements and Setbacks:**\n*   **Lot A:** Single-Family, 30' setback\n*   **Lot B:** Single-Family, 33' setback\n*   **Lot C:** Flag lot (excluded from calculation)\n*   **Lot D:** Single-Family, 20' setback (identified as \"Smallest (D)\" and excluded)\n*   **Lot E:** Single-Family, 37' setback (identified as \"Largest (E)\" and excluded)\n*   **Lot F:** Single-Family, 35' setback\n*   **Lot G:** Multiple-Family (3 + units) (excluded from calculation)\n*   **Lot H:** Lot fronts onto other street / Street sideyard (excluded from calculation)\n\n**Key (Legend):**\n*   Lot line: Dashed line\n*   Sidewalk: Patterned rectangle\n*   Curb: Thick solid line\n*   Required setbacks: Dashed line with small dashes\n*   Buildable area: Light gray shaded area\n*   Existing house: Solid black rectangle",
