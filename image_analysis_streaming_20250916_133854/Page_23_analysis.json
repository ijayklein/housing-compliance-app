    "raw_content": "Here's the extracted information from the image, focusing on crucial zoning rules, regulations, and technical specifications with absolute precision:\n\n**Title:** 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\n\n**Rule/Regulation:**\nAreas higher than 17' and 26' above the first floor (that do not already count as floor area e.g., open atrium spaces and inaccessible attic spaces), count toward the gross floor area in the form of 2nd and 3rd floor equivalency regardless of the floor plan or usage of the space. Stairwells will be measured the same way that vaulted ceiling spaces are measured.\n\n**Note:** 200 sf of 3rd floor equivalency may be exempted where roof pitch is 4:12 or steeper (see \"Height\" section).\n\n**Examples of how highlighted areas count (from Fig 12):**\n\n*   **Area A:**\n    *   once as 1st floor,\n    *   again as 2nd floor, and\n    *   a third time as 3rd-floor equivalency\n\n*   **Area B:**\n    *   once as 1st floor,\n    *   again as 2nd-floor equivalency\n\n**Figure Description:** Fig 12 2nd & 3rd floor equivalency\n\n**Technical Specifications/Labels from Diagrams:**\n\n*   **Left Diagram (Area A & B):**\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the highest hatched area)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the middle hatched area)\n    *   \"26'\" (vertical dimension from 1st floor to top of roof material)\n    *   \"Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\" (label for the highest hatched area)\n    *   \"Top of roof material (Typical)\" (label pointing to the top of the roof)\n    *   \"17'\" (vertical dimension from 1st floor to a dashed line below the attic)\n    *   \"A\" (label for a hatched area)\n    *   \"B\" (label for a hatched area including stairs)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd floor\" (label for the hatched area labeled 'A')\n    *   \"Top of finished floor (Typical)\" (label pointing to the 1st floor level)\n    *   \"1st flr\" (label for the 1st floor level)\n\n*   **Right Diagram (Area A & B with Vaulted Ceiling Space):**\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 3rd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the highest hatched area)\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd-floor equivalency\" (pointing to the middle hatched area)\n    *   \"26'\" (vertical dimension from 1st floor to top of roof material)\n    *   \"Inaccessible attic (or vaulted ceiling)\" (label for the highest hatched area)\n    *   \"Top of roof material (Typical)\" (label pointing to the top of the roof)\n    *   \"17'\" (vertical dimension from 1st floor to a dashed line below the attic)\n    *   \"A\" (label for a hatched area)\n    *   \"B\" (label for a hatched area)\n    *   \"Vaulted ceiling space\" (label for a hatched area in the upper part of 'B')\n    *   \"Width of area that counts as 2nd floor\" (label for the hatched area labeled 'A')\n    *   \"1st fl\" (label for the 1st floor level)\n\n**Page Number:** 17",
