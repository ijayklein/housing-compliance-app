    "raw_content": "Here's the extracted information from the images, presented with absolute precision:\n\n**Accessory structures site planning**\n\n**Note:** Site planning for accessory buildings differs from that for parking structures in one way. A special allowance enables garages to be located in the rear/side yards even when the lot is not deep enough to maintain the 75' minimum distance from the front lot line. This does not apply to non-parking accessory structures.\n\n**Fig 24 Examples of site planning solutions for accessory structures**\n\n**A Combo garage /small pool cabana (side by side)**\n*   Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n    *   a. be at least 75' from the front lot line\n    *   b. be no more than 12' high\n    *   c. comply with accessory-structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)\n*   Structure is located right at the side lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.\n*   Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.\n\n**B Stand-alone pool cabana**\n*   Structure is located in rear yard so it must:\n    *   a. be at least 75' from the front lot line\n    *   b. be no more than 12' high\n    *   c. comply with accessory-structure daylight plane. (Figs 25 & 26 on p. 32)\n*   Structure is located right at the rear lot line so that wall and the roof must be fire rated.\n*   Structure has 3 plumbing fixtures\u2014 sink, toilet, and shower and is greater than 200 sf, so it requires a CUP.\n\n**C Office above garage**\n*   Structure is located within the buildable area, so it doesn't have to comply with regulations for structures in the required yards and it may be two stories high.\n*   Structure has 2 plumbing fixtures.\n*   Structure is new 2nd floor addition and therefore subject to the Planning Department's Individual Review (IR).\n\n**Note:** Because this structure is 2 stories, it must be located within the buildable area regardless of the distances from the lot lines and is subject to Individual Review (IR).\n\n**Diagram Information:**\n\n**Interior lot example (for Combo garage/small pool house):**\n*   \"Combo garage/small pool house\" is located in the \"Rear yard\".\n*   Minimum 75' distance from the front lot line to the accessory structure.\n*   The accessory structure is located along the \"Interior-side yard\".\n*   \"Main dwelling\" is located in front of the accessory structure.\n*   \"Front yard\" is indicated.\n\n**Interior lot example (for Larger pool cabana):**\n*   \"Larger pool cabana\" is located in the \"Rear yard\".\n*   Minimum 75' distance from the front lot line to the accessory structure.\n*   The accessory structure is located along the \"Interior-side yard\".\n*   \"Main dwelling\" is located in front of the accessory structure.\n*   \"2-car attached garage\" is shown attached to the \"Main dwelling\".\n*   \"Front yard\" is indicated.\n\n**Corner lot example (for Office above garage):**\n*   \"Office above garage\" is located in the \"Rear yard\".\n*   Minimum 3' distance from the street-side yard to the accessory structure.\n*   The accessory structure is located along the \"Street-side yard\".\n*   \"Main dwelling\" is located in front of the accessory structure.\n*   \"Front yard\" is indicated.\n\n**Key:**\n*   **Curb:** Solid black line\n*   **Lot line:** Thin black line\n*   **Sidewalk:** Patterned grey area\n*   **Required setbacks:** Dashed black line\n*   **Buildable area:** Light grey dashed outline\n*   **Dwelling/parking:** Dark grey solid area\n*   **Accessory structure:** Black solid area\n\nPage number: 31",
