The footprint of such features count twice toward gross floor area regardless of the design (including whether or not they are open).\n\nHow to measure the height of an entry feature in order to determine whether or not it is considered to be a vaulted entry feature (using Fig 6 - 8 as examples)\n\nFig 6 Entry feature with shed roof\n\nNote: If the entryway is considered to be a vaulted entryway the area will be counted as follows:\n* In this example, a portion of the entryway is recessed beyond the house facade and roof. It is included in the area that counts.\n* The area is measured to the outside material of the entryway feature.\n* The area counts TWICE toward gross floor area.\n\n**Isometric View**\n*   **Height** (indicated by a vertical arrow from the grade to the top of the entry feature)\n*   **Grade** (indicated by a horizontal line at the base of the entry feature)\n\n**Side Elevation**\n*   **Intersection of front facade and top of roof material** (indicated by a horizontal line at the top of the entry feature)\n*   **Height** (indicated by a vertical arrow from the bottom of the entry feature to the intersection of the front facade and top of roof material)\n\n**Porch Floor Plan**\n*   **Outline of entryway roof** (indicated by a thin line)\n*   **Outline of entryway floor area that counts TWICE if entryway is vaulted** (indicated by a thick line)",
