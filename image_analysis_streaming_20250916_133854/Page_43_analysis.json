Front-half pattern lots**\n*   lots with garage in front half of the lot (F)\n\n**2. Rear-half pattern lots**\n*   lots with garage in the rear half of the lot (B & D) and\n*   lots with no garage (E) (counts as a rear-pattern lot)\n\nDetermine which pattern category is predominant i.e., into which category more than half of the lots fall.\n\n**If \"Rear half\" is predominant:**\nThe contextual-garage-placement regulation DOES apply. Projects on this block must place the garage in the rear half of the lot.\n\n**Fig 32 Example of a block on which the contextual garage placement regulation applies**\n\n**Labels in Fig 32:**\n*   A: Garage, House (crossed out)\n*   B: Garage, House\n*   C: Garage, House (crossed out)\n*   D: Garage, House\n*   E: House\n*   F: Subject House, Garage\n*   G: Multiple garages, House (crossed out)\n*   H: Garage, House (crossed out)",
