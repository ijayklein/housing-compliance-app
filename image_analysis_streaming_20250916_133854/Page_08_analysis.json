    "raw_content": "**Lot size**\n\nThe characteristics of a lot determine its development potential and chief among these characteristics is the area of the lot.\n\nFor example, to assure continuity in the appearance of the streetscape throughout our neighborhoods and city, the allowable building size is based on a percentage of the lot area.\n\n**Code sections**\nPage 2\n18.12.040 (a) Table 2\n18.12.040 (d)\n18.12.040 (c)\nPage 3\n18.04.030 (a) (85)\n\n**Minimum & maximum lot sizes**\n\nAs Palo Alto developed and grew through annexation, each subdivision evolved with unique characteristics e.g., the size of the lots within the subdivision. Five R-1 zones reflect and preserve traditional lotting patterns with criteria for minimum and maximum lot sizes.\n\n**Min. & max. lot sizes by zone**\n\nThe subdivision ordinance requires a new lot to have:\nA) width \u2265 60' AND depth \u2265 100' AND\nB) lot area (in sf) per the following:\n\n| Zone District | Minimum | Maximum |\n|---|---|---|\n| R-1 | 6,000 | 9,999 |\n| R-1(7000) | 7,000 | 13,999 |\n| R-1(8000) | 8,000 | 15,999 |\n| R-1(10000) | 10,000 | 19,999 |\n| R-1(20000) | 20,000 | 39,999 |\n\n**Exceptions to the max. lot size**\n* Where underlying lot lines must be removed to eliminate non-conformities and results in no net loss of housing.\n* Where an adjacent substandard lot of less than 25' in width is combined with another lot and results in no net loss of housing.\n* Where the resultant number of lots increases or stays the same and results in no net loss of housing.\n\n**Substandard lots**\n\nEven within each R-1 zone there are a variety of lot sizes. Smaller lots that meet the following criteria are considered to be substandard.\n\n**Substandard lot sizes by zone**\n\nA sub-standard lot is one with:\nA) width < 50' OR depth < 83' AND\nB) area \u2264 the following (83% of min. lot size):\n\n| Zone District | Typical lot | Flag lot |\n|---|---|---|\n| R-1 | 4,980 | 5,976 |\n| R-1(7000) | 5,810 | 6,972 |\n| R-1(8000) | 6,640 | 7,968 |\n| R-1(10000) | 8,300 | 9,960 |\n| R-1(20000) | 16,600 | 19,920 |\n\n**Special regulations for substandard lots**\n* Maximum building height is single-story and 17' instead of 30'.\n* For lots less than 50' wide, the required street-side yard is 10' instead of 16'. (Fig 15 C on p. 23)\n* For lots less than 95' deep, the requirements for locating a garage in the rear or side yards are that it be in the rear half of the lot instead of 75' back from the front lot line.\n\n**Note:** Determining where lot lines are on the ground may require a boundary survey.",
