Front-half pattern lots\n\u2022 lots with garage in front half of the lot (F)\n\n2. Rear-half pattern lots\n\u2022 lots with garage in the rear half of the lot (B & D) and\n\u2022 lots with no garage (E) (counts as a rear-pattern lot)\n\nDetermine which pattern category is predominant i.e., into which category more than half of the lots fall.\n\nFront half\n\nRear half\n\nThe contextual garage placement regulation DOES apply. Projects on this block must place the garage in the rear half of the lot.\n\nFig 32 Example of a block on which the contextual garage placement regulation applies\n\n[DIAGRAM SHOWING: A street layout with lots labeled A through H, showing houses and garages in different positions. The diagram includes measurements and shows how the contextual garage placement rule is applied to determine front-half vs rear-half patterns.]",
