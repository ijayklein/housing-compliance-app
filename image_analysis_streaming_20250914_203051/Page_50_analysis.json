(see table)\n\u2022 Maximum size is 450 sf (basement area counts towards the size of the 2nd-dwelling unit even if it does not count toward total gross floor area.)\n\u2022 Maximum height is 17'.\n\u2022 Must have two parking spaces (one to be covered).\n\u2022 Maximum size for covered parking is 200 sf. (This is in addition to the 450 sf allowed for the 2nd-dwelling unit.)\n\u2022 Except on corner lots, entrance way shall not face same lot line as entrance to main dwelling.\n\u2022 Exterior staircases to 2nd floor units shall be located toward interior side or rear yard.\n\u2022 Must be located within the setbacks just like the main dwelling.

See \"Site planning for attached garages/carports\" and \"Site planning for detached garages/carports\" in the \"Parking\" section of this manual. Note that parking for the 2nd dwelling unit may be combined with parking for the main residence e.g., a two-car garage as shown in Fig 23 C & D.",
